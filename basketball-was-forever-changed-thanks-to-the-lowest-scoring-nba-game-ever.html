This was a man so dominant in the middle that the New York Knicks once advertised a December 1949 home game as "Geo. Mikan vs. Knicks," as noted by <a href=#>The New York Times</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Just how good was Mikan on paper? According to the 1949-50 Lakers' <a href=#>Basketball-Reference</a>&nbsp;page, the former DePaul star averaged 27.4 points on a team that scored 84.1 points per game — that's nearly a third of his entire team's average. He also shot 40.7% from the field and 77.9% from the free-throw line, with the former figure being much better than the Lakers' team shooting percentage of 36.7%.</p><p>On November 22, 1950, the Fort Wayne (later Detroit) Pistons headed to Minneapolis to play the mighty Lakers, and head coach Murray Mendenhall came up with a novel idea to counter the Lakers' high-powered (at least for that era)&nbsp;offense. And that was to stall, stall, stall; hold on to the ball for as long as possible in hopes of denying the Lakers a chance to dump it down low to the big guy for the easy home win — potentially their 30th straight, per <a href=#>ESPN</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCFk2pqb2pfl660t8StmZqknGLEor%2BMn6arnaaav26vx5qloJ2UYsGprc2kqmasn2LBqbGMpaawnaOperSvzqugp59do6%2BiecaapJ5llauys3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
