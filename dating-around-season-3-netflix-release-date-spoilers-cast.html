At the end of each episode, the singleton will pick a person to go on a second date. Yup, that's it! No crazy gimmicks like we've seen in past on shows like&nbsp;Love Is Blind&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/g32315418/too-hot-to-handle-netflix-facts/>Too Hot to Handle</a>.</p><p>The cast changes each season.

Yes, I'm as bummed as you are that we don't have confirmation. I'm crossing my fingers, though, because it did only&nbsp;just&nbsp;premiere on June 12, so we'll give them some time.</p><p>It's also important to note that while&nbsp;Dating Around&nbsp;didn't get the hype of the streaming giant's other dating shows, it did get renewed! According to&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/02/netflix-dating-around-season-2.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Vulture</a>, the year-long gap between the first and second season announcement led some viewers (me!) to think the show was a goner. The truth of the matter was that the second season had already filmed. A rep for the series told&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url="https://www.bustle.com/p/will-dating-around-return-for-season-3-it-may-be-a-long-wait-for-news-22976215#:~:text=Netflix%20hasn't%20announced%20any,and%20Too%20Hot%20to%20Handle." referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Bustle</a>&nbsp;season two of the show filmed in October 2019.</p><p>So, what does this mean for the third season? It's unclear—the show could get renewed, but that means it wouldn't come out on Netflix probably until 2021 due to&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/politics/a32404944/navajo-nation-women-covid-19/>COVID-19</a>&nbsp;halting the majority of productions.
