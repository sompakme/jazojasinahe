They may be used interchangeably, as you pointed out. We have a 1157 with the serial number 30-90-157.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>In addition, how does a 1157 bulb function exactly?</h3><p>&nbsp;In the instance of the 1157 bulb, the elements are 26.8W and 8.3W, respectively, and produce around a 10:1 difference in lumens (with the brighter brake light filament having a lifespan of approximately 1/4 the longer). This kind of light bulb contains more than two contacts, making it a multi-contact light bulb. This kind of light bulb has three contacts and is keyed so that it can only be used in one direction.</p><h3>So, which automobiles are equipped with 1156 bulbs?</h3><p>These bulbs are used as tail lights in a broad variety of automobiles, including those manufactured by Honda, Toyota/Lexus, Kia, Subaru, Chrysler, and Volkswagen, among others. All of our 1156 and 1157-size LED replacement tail light bulbs are constructed with the highest-quality components to assure years of trouble-free operation!</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What is the purpose of a 2057 bulb?</h3><p>Parking lights, turn signals, brake lights, back-up lights, interior lights, and more uses are all made possible by the Sylvania 2057 Long-Life Miniature Bulb, which comes in a pack of two bulbs. Bulb life is much longer than that of standard bulbs. On-road usage is permissible</p><h3>Is it possible to use 1034 and 1157 bulbs interchangeably?</h3><p>There is a difference between 1034 and 1157 automobile bulbs. After a prolonged period of usage, automotive lighting begin to fail. For example, a 1157 automotive light and a 1034 lamp are both electrically compatible with one another. However, there are some significant distinctions between the two lights that may make one of them a better choice for your particular scenario than the other.</p><h3></h3><h3>What is a brighter bulb than the 1157?</h3><p>The bulb bases of the 1157 and the 2357 are similar to one another. Installed a total of 2357 bulbs in each of the driver’s side rearview mirrors. The brightness of the running lights is the same between the 1157 and the 2357. The brake lights on the 2357 are brighter than the brake lights on the 1157, as demonstrated in the photo below.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3></h3><h3>Is the bulb for the brake lights and turn signals the same?</h3><p>Each light bulb has two filaments, one on each side of the bulb. Both your brake light and turn signal are located on the same circuit. As a result, while you’re stopped and your turn signal is activated, one filament remains illuminated while the other blinks. As a result, when this bulb fails, both your turn signal and brake light are turned off.</p><h3></h3><h3>What is the brightest 1157 LED bulb that you can find?</h3><p>LUYED 2 X 1700 Lumens Extremely Bright 1157 4014 102-EX Chipsets 1157 2057 2357 7528LED Bulbs,Xenon White 1157 4014 102-EX Chipsets 1157 2057 2357 7528LED Bulbs,Xenon White (Brightest LED in market)</p><h3></h3><h3>When it comes to light bulbs, what is the difference between 1157 and 3157?</h3><p>&nbsp;Simply stated, they are their primary points of contact. In other words, a 1156/3156 is a single filament bulb that is exclusively utilised in situations where just one filament is required, such as reversing lights, running lights, and other similar applications. A 1157/3157, on the other hand, has two filaments.</p><h3></h3><h3>A brake light bulb has a wattage of how many watts?</h3><p>Alternatively, I was thinking that when you apply the brake, the light uses 27 watts of electricity, however when it is merely on, it draws only 8 watts of power.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3></h3><h3>What are the brightest tail light bulbs that you can find?</h3><p>The following are our evaluations of the top five LED tail light bulbs currently available on the market: Super Bright LED Tail Light Bulbs with 900 Lumens LUYED by 2 X 900 Lumens.

Lumens: 402 Candlepower: 32 Candlepower: 1003 Watts:12.00 Current:0.938 Watts:12.00 Power of a candle: 15 Lumens: 189 (I have one of these in my backyard.)</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3></h3><h3>Are the 1141 and 1156 bulbs interchangeable?</h3><p>What makes the difference is the element. The 1156 is a 12v 2.1 amp 26.9 watt device having a life expectancy of 1200 hours. The 1141, on the other hand, is 12v, 1.44 amps, and 18.4 watts with a life of 500 hours. The 1156 generates 32 candle power, whilst the 1141 generates just 21.</p><h3></h3><h3>What does the number 21 5w mean?</h3><p>The P21/5W is the European version of the twin filament lamp, and it has a power rating of 5 watts. In this case, the main filament (brake or turn application) consumes 21 watts, while the minor filament consumes 5. (parking lamp). The 1073 is the closest refit for the P21W, while the 1034 is the closest retrofit for the P21/5W, although these two lamps may be difficult to come by.</p><h3></h3><h3>Which filament is responsible for the turn signal?</h3><p>The low filament contact for parking lights and tail lights is on the contact nearest to you, while the high filament contact for turn signals and brake lights is on the contact farther away. Take a look at the filaments that are within the bulb as well. One is thinner and has a greater resistance, allowing it to draw less current and emit less light than the other.</p><h3></h3><h3>What is the function of a brake light bulb?</h3><p>The wiring arrangement for the brake lights in most automobiles is not particularly complicated. On one end, you have the lights themselves: bulbs in sockets that are linked to a wire harness. On the other end, you have the wiring harness. The brake switch is located at the opposite end of the circuit, where the pedal is depressed, creating contact that completes the circuit. A portion of the system’s power comes from the vehicle’s battery.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZ3xxfY6wn5qso2LBqbGMnaCfnpWnsq%2BvxGaZnqynmrKveZBqbG9lkaOxbn2Qbm5mmqWhr7R6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
