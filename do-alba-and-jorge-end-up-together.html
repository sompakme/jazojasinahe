Alba developed a crush on Jorge 3 years after they began working together in the Marbella gift shop.</p><h2>What happens to Alba in Jane the Virgin?</h2>Alright, I'm going to be honest, I was nervous during the ENTIRE series finale that Alba was going to die! But, fear not. Alba was right when she said everyone eventually gets a happy ending. In the series finale, Alba officiates Jane's wedding and takes some time to reflect on the happy life she's created in the US.<h2>What episode does Alba marry Jorge?</h2>Trying to figure out how to be the best parent for Mateo dovetails really nicely into another story in “Chapter Ninety-Two,” the one about Jorge and Alba's marriage.<h2>Do Xo and Rogelio end up together?</h2>Then, Rogelio and Xo wrap the bride and groom in a traditional Mexican wedding lasso. Yes, it's impossible not to wonder where this supposedly cherished De La Vega family heirloom was during Jane's first wedding with Michael Cordero (Brett Dier), but you give the series a pass when emotions are running this high.<h2>Jane The Virgin 4×17 Alba and Jorge get married</h2><p></p><h2>Who did Petra end up with?</h2>Petra meets and gets engaged to Lachlan Moore, who worked for The Maracay Group, owned by Emilio Solano and during a business dinner, she met Emilio's son and Lachlan's rival, Rafael Solano. Petra left Lachlan for Rafael, as he had more money and the two got engaged after five months of being together.<h2>Does Xiomara get pregnant?</h2>When Xiomara got pregnant with Jane she was 16, and Rogelio was 17. Xiomara decided not to include Rogelio in her and Jane's life as he told her to have an abortion, once she revealed to him that she was pregnant.<h2>Does Jorge actually love Alba?</h2>But then, he confirms that he does — he loves Alba, which is the first time he's said it to her. Alba says it back and they are so in love and happy at this milestone. Jorge helps Alba gather things for Xiomara and Rogelio's impromptu wedding during a hurricane at The Marbella.<h2>What happens with Jorge and Alba?</h2>But in "Chapter 89," Jorge confesses that he loves Alba and she reciprocates the emotion. Since these characters have already been through so much and it's the final season, it sure seems that Alba and Jorge will end the show happily in love.<h2>Does Alba get her green card?</h2>Alba gets her green card!!! Mateo Villanueva made a Christmas angel ornament, that the Villanueva's put atop the tree every Christmas. Jane realizes that she may have been too stuck in her own viewpoint, especially regarding Rafael. Rafael is still reeling from the murder of his father and the kidnapping of Mateo.<h2>Does Jane donate an egg to Lina?</h2>The next day, Jane bites the bullet and tells Lina that she will give her one of her eggs. Lina is thrilled at the news and then politely declines.<h2>Do Xo and Bruce get married?</h2>They start of tense, as Xo was unhappy with the way things ended between them, with him ultimately never following through on leaving his wife for Xo. They did have real feelings for each other despite the circumstances, and when they reconnect 2 years later, Bruce has divorced.<h2>Does Jane get a divorce?</h2>After Jane learns that she is still married to Michael, she decides to get divorced from him so she can move on with Rafael.<h2>Who ends up with who in Jane the Virgin?</h2>The episode featured a happy ending for its titular character, as Jane (Gina Rodriguez) married her on- and off-again boyfriend, Rafael (Justin Baldoni), and sold the novel telling the story of her life for $500,000.<h2>Does Xo cheat on Ro?</h2>In one of them, Rogelio accuses Xo of cheating on him (I was not a fan of this move), then becomes way too into trying to support her with her dance partner (fine), and then, after a huge blow-up with Xo, he allows his inner critic to speak to him (yesss).<h2>Who does Louisa end up with in Jane the Virgin?</h2>Rose Solano<p>While in the subsequent years, Luisa marries her then-girlfriend Allison (who is found cheating in the Pilot) and Rose marries Emilio Solano, Rose and Luisa are secretly lovers (whether this happens in between their first meeting in 2010 and Season 1, is unclear).</p><h2>Does Jane get back with Michael?</h2>That's when it became clear to viewers: The newly returned Michael—the man she had been happily married to—wasn't a serious option anymore. Instead, his return was simply a way for the writers to allow Jane to officially “choose” Rafael this time, not once but twice: first over Jason, then over the real Michael.<h2>Is Rafael A Solano?</h2>As it turns out, Rafael (Justin Baldoni), Jane's (accidental) baby-daddy, is not a Solano. In Monday night's episode we found out that Rafael was actually adopted. We even got a glimpse at Rafael's birth certificate, which says he was born in Italy.<h2>Why did Rose take Michael?</h2>Rafael tells them that Rose abducted Michael after drugging him so his heart rate would slow enough to simulate death. She then fried his temporal lobe and hippocampus with electroshock, until he couldn't remember who he was.<h2>How old is Alba in Jane the Virgin?</h2>They are also reasons why she's a total badass. Here are seven ways Alba Villanueva, professional 66-year-old grandma, can school you on badassery. Her love for TV is next-level.<h2>Do Darci and Rogelio get back together?</h2>Three years later, Darci and Rogelio have broken up because Rogelio couldn't go through with having kids with Darci after all. She resents him for having broken their deal (perhaps her heart?), but they still work together as Rogelio is contracted to the reality series until he breaks his contract.<h2>Does Petra come out of the coma?</h2>Prompted by Jane's suspicions in the previous episode, Rafael hangs out in Petra's room long enough to prevent Anezka from administering the paralytic, and Petra finally emerges from her three months in hell.<h2>Does Jane have another baby?</h2>Jane welcomes Mateo into her life, but she also welcomes her former nemesis Petra, baby daddy Rafael, father Rogelio, and a host of other people.<h2>Does Petra get a happy ending?</h2>She was also given a fantastic happy ending thanks to the return of her ex-girlfriend JR (Rosario Dawson) to her life. Petra was allowed to invite anyone that she liked to the Jane and Rafael's rehearsal dinner as her plus one.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8OoZJqkkpZ6orrDZqGoqpeaeqa6w2asqWWkpLSmwMeeqQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
