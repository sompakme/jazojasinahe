With WWE and UFC having merged to form TKO Holdings Group, it appears Shane McMahon wanted to buy the UFC in the past but Vince McMahon stopped him many times.</p><p>As previously reported, the new name of the publicly traded&nbsp;<a href=#>company as result of WWE and UFC’s merger would be TKO Group Holdings</a>. WWE and UFC’s deal was also finalized just yesterday,&nbsp;<a href=#>as the companies were featured in front of The New York Stock Exchange</a>.</p><p>While speaking to Big Boy TV, UFC President Dana White revealed Shane McMahon was interested in purchasing the company during the early 2000s. However, Vince McMahon stopped his son from acquiring the UFC.</p><p>“Vince McMahon, from what I hear, his son Shane wanted to buy the UFC. Vince had the opportunity to buy it. And Vince said, ‘Yeah. No. We’re not gonna buy it.’ Vince could have bought this thing and just put it on the shelf. Or Vince could have bought it and let his son [run it].”</p><p>The TKO Holdings Group also launched their&nbsp;<a href=#>own website following the WWE and UFC merger finalization</a>. We will have to wait and see whether WWE will ultimately benefit from this merger, as Vince McMahon is no longer the one in power at WWE.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What do you think of this shocking story about Shane McMahon?
