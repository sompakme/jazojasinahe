Peckham</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article19335408.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Peckham16.jpg><p>Peckham is apparently the most dangerous place to live in London, if you believe the testimonies of these Londoners.</p><p>Among the areas problems, gang activity seems to be the biggest factor in its lofty ranking.</p><p>One person wrote: "I have lived there for 2 weeks and moved straight away! Horrible place, so many mugs and gangs!"</p><p>Another came out in force to condemn the entire area, writing: "Peckham is a disgusting place. If you live there you're basically done out.</p><p>"It's an awful city and I don't understand why anyone would wish to live there. It is a horrible place, it's a dump, it stinks."</p><p>But others disagreed, stating that Peckham couldn't possibly be the worst place in London as it was filled with 'yuppies'.</p><p>They said: "No way number one it's just a bunch of yuppies everywhere."</p><h3>2. Brixton</h3><p>Surprisingly, the vibrant South London town of Brixton was named the second most dangerous location on the list.</p><p>According to one Londoner, it is risky to even look someone in the eye in the borough.</p><p>They said: "I live in Brixton and I don't really go out at night anymore because I don't want to get approached by gangs.</p><p>"In Brixton it's literally a big thing to make eye contact with someone, an argument could start from a small thing like that."</p><p>Another claimed that he was mugged in the area on a 'daily basis' which slightly stretches the credulity this reporter is willing to grant his testimony.</p><p>It wasn't all bad though, one person said that despite it's reputation Brixton was actually a very safe place.</p><p>They said: "Big up Brixton! Good place to live, most safest place in London by far!"</p><p><b>See the crimes that have been reported in your area with In Your Area.</b></p><h3>3. Tottenham</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article19621103.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_Crouch_End_Tottenham_Lane_N8_-_geographorguk_-_988060.jpg><p>Tottenham was unlucky enough to come third on the list of London's most dangerous areas.</p><p>One person was so damning in their criticism of Tottenham they advised people never to visit it.</p><p>They said: "I would honestly say Tottenham is by far the worst in London.</p><p>"The area is filled with gangs, estates, drugs and much more. It is an area where if your not from there you shouldn't really be visiting."</p><p>Another opined that the area hid behind the reputation of the football club.</p><p>They said: "It is a failed area full of gang culture, but doesn't get the recognition as it is known to be where the football club is."</p><p>But one person disagreed with the slander and mounted an impassioned defence of the area.</p><p>They wrote: "This was the only way I could find to post my opinion.</p><p>"Reading the comments and releasing what negative connotations people have or Tottenham nearly brought tears to my eyes.</p><p>"I have lived in Tottenham all my life and have felt a sense of community; I also feel lucky that due to the cultural diversity in Tottenham I have learnt about other cultures - broadening my horizons."</p><h3>4. Hackney</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/weather/article20257157.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Blossom.jpg><p>Hackney came fourth on the list but had been mentioned in many of the top 3's grievances often as a comparison.</p><p>One user denigrated the entire concept of living in the area.</p><p>They opined: "Crime, street fights, graffiti, murder, drug dealing are literally the Hackney features. Is going there, living there let alone safe?</p><p>"Not in the slightest. I would love to know the percentage of people that love it, I would hazard a guess, it's quite low."</p><p>But one person disagreed and said Hackney was no more dangerous than any other London area.</p><p>They stated: "I'm moving to Hackney soon, I know people that lived there all their life and it can be dangerous but it's getting better and like most places just be careful where you walk alone and at night, avoid dark streets and with few people, if you can just drive where you need, you'll feel safer and it's safer.</p><p>"Otherwise during daylight it is relatively safe."</p><h3>5. Croydon</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/article20370095.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Croydon-High-Street.png><p>Rounding out the top five was Croydon with most user complaints stemming from the perceived mugging culture that had sprung up on street corners.</p><p>One person lamented the lack of police action to stem the tide of 'muggers'.</p><p>They said: "Kerb crawling is not responsible thing to do it can get you arrested by police so if you are doing this</p><p>"Kind of activity please be aware that it is classed as anti social behaviour which police do not tolerated it will land you in serious trouble by being arrested."</p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><p>Another gave the town an ignominious title.</p><p>They said: "Croydon is an antisocial muggers paradise!"</p><p>But as ever, there were some people who disagreed with the slanders directed at the area.</p><p>They said: "Croydon isn't rough at all it's the same as any other place in London."</p><h3>6. Edmonton</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article17739590.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Edmonton-GreenJPG.jpg><p>Edmonton also suffers from a poor reputation from Top 10 users.</p><p>One person was so angry with the area they proposed a radical solution.</p><p>They wrote: "Nuke Edmonton. It is a useless London area with too many illiterate, materialistic, money-obsessive wannabe gangsters run by a useless Labour MP."</p><p>Another recounted a terrifying story of being mugged twice in the same night.</p><p>They said: "Do not go there I'm from hackney and I thought hackneys dangerous not after I went to my mates house at Edmonton.</p><p>"Nightmare I only got robbed twice and been victim of a knife once and it was all in Edmonton and I've only been there five times."</p><p>Another resident then appeared to defend the area in a backhanded way: "Edmonton isn't that bad. I live there and it's quite OK, despite the fact it's a bit dangerous and a bit unsafe. Better if you stay indoors most of the time."</p><h3>7. Stockwell</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article17391095.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_swan.png><p>Stockwell had fewer accounts posted than many others on the list.</p><p>But there was still room for hyperbole, with one screaming: "Stockwell is worse than Brixton believe me!" whilst another lamented the 'war zone' aesthetic of the area.</p><p>However perhaps a fairer assessment of the area can be found in the account of an American lady who recently moved to Stockwell.</p><p>She wrote: "I find Stockwell a charming community with an identity, a small town feeling of sorts.</p><p>"I've walked the streets of Stockwell at all hours, including coming home from clubbing in the wee hours of the morning.</p><p>"Never once have I felt threatened or uneasy."</p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><h3>8. Stonebridge Estate Harlesden</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article13375619.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Stonebridge-estate-housingJPG.jpg><p>The Stonebridge Estate in Harlesden came in for special commendation on the list securing an entry irrespective of the town it was situated in.</p><p>One person raged: "This should definitely be in the top 5. One of the most hated ends in north-west London."</p><p>The reasons for the area's notoriety were noticeably thin on the ground in the comment section, with most pointing to the spectre of gang violence.</p><p>The fairest comment read: "Its calmed down since it was rebuilt, but the area is still bad with the gang crime that goes on there."</p><h3>9. Tulse Hill</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/news/south-london-news/article15653746.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_PalaceRoad.png><p>The penultimate entry onto the list of 'dangerous' London areas was South London's Tulse Hill.</p><p>According to users, the Lambeth district has a problem with youth crime.</p><p>One person wrote: "Full of youth crime youth violence and young gangs. Not a good environment for a young person to experience life!"</p><p>Another admitted that the area had a gang problem, but that on the whole they behaved better than other gangs, writing: "In general the gangs in Tulse Hill are kinder than other areas."</p><h3>10. Custom House</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article20420910.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_cUSTOM-hOUSEPNG.png><p>Closing out the list of 'dangerous' London areas was the area around Custom House, which sits on the banks of the Thames near the Royal Victoria footbridge.</p><p>On the surface the area looks quite ordinary, but residents are convinced their are darker things going on below the surface.</p><p>One user wrote: "Definitely the grittiest part of London, most involved borough in the Newham postcode war."</p><p>This alleged gang warfare is again referenced by another user who recounts a harrowing story.</p><p>They explained: "The area is known for homicides, shootings & drive by shootings.</p><p>"Have had tit for tat gang warfare coming up too a decade."</p><p>Strangely, this was also the only area on the top 10 list that attracted no positive messages in rebuttal.</p><p><b>Do you agree with the Top 10 list or do you think the areas have been judged unfairly?
