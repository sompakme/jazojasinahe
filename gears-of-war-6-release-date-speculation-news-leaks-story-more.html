But thanks to the release cycle of previous Gears titles, we have some ideas about when we might see it.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/xTcVK-tt_hyZW8PGEQZeUOx2YlPhxqKWdl6M4ZiFcbk/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9HZWFycy9HZWFyc19vZl9XYXJfNl9SZWxlYXNlX0RhdGUlMkNfTGVha3MlMkNfU3RvcnlfYW5kX01vcmUvR2VhcnNfb2ZfV2FyXzZfUmVsZWFzZV9EYXRlJTJDX0xlYWtzJTJDX1N0b3J5X2FuZF9Nb3JlX3JlbGVhc2VfZGF0ZS5qcGc><p>The developers would normally wait 2-3 years between releases, and we're now approaching three years since the release of Gears 5 in 2019. However, it appears that we may have to wait a little longer for the next installment of the series.</p><p>Back in 2021, The Coalition published a new <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> announcing the studio's transition to Unreal Engine 5. "Because transitioning to a new engine is a significant undertaking, we want to be clear that we will not be announcing any new projects or titles for some time," the studio said.</p><p>This could mean that we have to wait a few more years before we see Gears 6, and if we had to guess, a new game is still a few years away. The end of 2023 is an optimistic guess, but it's more likely. If all goes well, the Coalition will release Gears 6 in 2024 or 2025.</p><h2>Gears of War 6 Leaks</h2><p>Although there aren't any official leaks for Gears 6 at the moment, we do have some speculation about what we can expect. The game will likely stick to the third-person action game and cover shooter mechanics that have made the series famous.&nbsp;</p><p>However, chances are high that the developers might want to change up the formulae slightly and freshen the experience for new and seasoned players. Perhaps Gears 6 might lean more into the open-world RPG mechanics introduced in Gears 5, though perhaps with a tighter focus.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/DOj3TTE8DKWo8NYYGCigcVr6hZI7ogUiYHFRm2G4pu4/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9HZWFycy9HZWFyc19vZl9XYXJfNl9SZWxlYXNlX0RhdGUlMkNfTGVha3MlMkNfU3RvcnlfYW5kX01vcmUvR2VhcnNfb2ZfV2FyXzZfUmVsZWFzZV9EYXRlJTJDX0xlYWtzJTJDX1N0b3J5X2FuZF9Nb3JlX2xlYWtzLmpwZw><p>Although at the end of the day, these ideas are all speculation and don't reflect the actual gameplay experience as it will be released. So for now, we'll simply need to wait until The Coalition releases official information regarding Gears 6.&nbsp;</p><h2>Gears of War 6 Story - What To Expect</h2><p>Despite being a sequel to Gears of War 4, Gears 5 took the unusual step of pivoting away from the game's main character. The main story of Gears 4 revolved around J.D. Fenix, the son of Marcus Fenix and Anya Stroud. However, in Gears 5, the focus shifts to Kait Diaz, a prominent side character from Gears 4 who accompanies J.D.</p><p>At the end of Gears 5, Kait must decide whether to save JD or Delmont "Del" Walker. Reyna, Kait's mother, then kills whoever she doesn't choose to save. Although it's unclear which death is accepted as canon, we do not doubt that Gears 6 will carry on Kait's quest to find her mother Reyna, the Queen of the Swarm.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/-PT_GB_n66ij32-2fUKBdW5_q4cNkFLTl7HAWHeTrOE/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9HZWFycy9HZWFyc19vZl9XYXJfNl9SZWxlYXNlX0RhdGUlMkNfTGVha3MlMkNfU3RvcnlfYW5kX01vcmUvR2VhcnNfb2ZfV2FyXzZfUmVsZWFzZV9EYXRlJTJDX0xlYWtzJTJDX1N0b3J5X2FuZF9Nb3JlX3N0b3J5LmpwZw><p>Although there are two possible outcomes for The Coalition, we wouldn't rule out the possibility that Marcus Fenix will return to the lead role if the creative team decides to make JD's demise canon. There is undoubtedly something to be said about piquing fan interest in the franchise by having Marcus reprise his role as the protagonist as a furious, elderly father out for vengeance.</p><p>For now, all we can do is speculate as there's no official word regarding Gears 6, but needless to say, we're excited to see the future of this successful third-person shooter.
