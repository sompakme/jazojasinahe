As you've probably guessed, this involves eating more plants and cutting animal products for the first month of the year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wondering if you should give Veganuary a try? Here's everything you need to know about how to switch to a plant-based diet and the health and environmental benefits of going vegan for a month.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>OatmealStories/Getty Images</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-where-did-veganuary-come-from></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Where Did Veganuary Come From?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Dry January</a>, the Veganuary challenge actually started in the U.K. back in 2014, when a non-profit organization by the same name encouraged people to try going vegan for the month of January. Fast forward to 2021 and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>the Veganuary website reports</a> that more than 500,000 people <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>signed up for the pledge</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, following an animal-free diet isn't anything new. World Vegan Day was established in 1994 and has only continued to see a growth in followers since. In 2014, only 1% of United States consumers said they were vegan; in 2017 that number jumped to 6%, according to a 2017 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>report by GlobalData</a>. Plenty of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>celebs have helped boost the popularity of veganism</a> along the way — including none other than Beyoncé, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>who promoted a 22-day vegan diet back in 2015</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The marketing of 'Veganuary' in particular really took off in 2020 when Google searches for the term soared. Even Hollywood took note by announcing that the 2020 Golden Globes, which took place on January 5, would feature an all-vegan menu.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-are-there-health-benefits-to-going-vegan></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Are There Health Benefits to Going Vegan?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A plant-based diet packed with a variety of fruits and veggies has been linked to a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>reduced risk of type 2 diabetes</a>, heart disease, and cancer, according to Barbie Boules, R.D.N., the founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Barbie Boules Longevity Nutrition</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"A plant-based food philosophy is rich in fiber, vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients, and hydration," Boules says, adding that adding more plants to your plate also promotes a healthy gut microbiome.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And the health benefits of a vegan diet can be seen even from short-term efforts: In a 2019 review published in the journal <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Nature</a>, the authors noted improved glucose, insulin, and cholesterol levels, as well as weight loss and decreased inflammation for participants who maintained a plant-based diet for anywhere from three to 24 months. Another <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>2018 study</a> showed participants had reduced total cholesterol after going vegan for just four weeks — aka the length of Veganuary.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-about-the-environmental-benefits></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What About the Environmental Benefits?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sure, there are health benefits to going vegan, but a plant-based diet can benefit the planet, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A 2018 study published in the journal<i> <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Nature</a></i> showed that maintaining a Western diet high in animal products and processed foods at its current rate could cause a spike in food-related climate change contributors — including water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions — by as much as 90 percent by 2050.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another 2019 report in The Lancet showed a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, and nuts (and reduced consumption of red meat, sugar, and refined grains) not only has personal health benefits, but is the healthiest diet for the planet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In fact, it's the main reason why the Golden Globes ceremony decided to go vegan last year. "The climate crisis is impossible to ignore and after speaking with our peers, and friends in the community, we felt challenged to do better," the Hollywood Foreign Press Association president Lorenzo Soria said in a statement to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Los Angeles Times</a>. The decision to serve a plant-based meal, Soria said, was in an effort to take "a small step in response to a big problem."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-get-started-with-veganuary></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Get Started with Veganuary</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">OK, so when it comes to giving Veganuary a shot, there's really no reason not to up our intake of produce, whole grains, and healthy nuts and seeds. One thing Boules does caution, however, is that you'll want to commit to planning your meals in order to ensure adequate nutrient intake, especially if you plan to go vegan for good.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"A nutritionally-complete, strict vegan diet requires effort and planning," she noted, adding that you'll have to pay special attention to calcium, vitamin D, B12, and omega 3s, which are not adequately found in plants and other vegan foods.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But what about protein? (If you're a vegetarian, then you've heard this one more times than you can count, right?) Beans, legumes, edamame, tofu, and quinoa are all protein-packed options to reach for on a vegan diet, Boules says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If the idea of giving up cheese forever seems hard to fathom, there's good news. Boules is quick to point out that you can still reap the benefits of incorporating more plants in your life without committing to going full vegan.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I love the idea of filling half your plate with veggies at every meal, and perhaps making one meal a day totally plant-based," Boules says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Moral of the story? Trying Veganuary might be your ticket to better understanding what it means to lead a plant-based lifestyle — even if you end up just going Vegan-ish.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8Wopp1llKe2r7eOsJ%2BarF2ewG7CxKCYp62Rp8Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
