Picking a Fortnite dance is not a matter of strict procedure but rather a matter of preferences. There are so many you could go for too. Here are a few you should look into.</p><h2>Top Fortnite dances</h2><p class=align-left>You may not know all Fortnite dance moves, but knowing a few could come in handy. Check out the following ten to keep yourself updated with what is going on.</p><h3>1. Best Mates</h3><p></p><p class=align-left>It is one of the dances that come with the weird swinging of hands and high knees. This one was invented by Marlon Webb on his Vine channel! From that time, a good number of people have copied it, which explains why it has been included among the popular game dances.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5d3e333a1cd2e5d5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Classic man: Look dapper and get the ladies like BBNaija's Emmanuel in different outfits</span></p></a><h3>2. Electro shuffle</h3><p></p><p class=align-left>It was a street dance that was done to electro music and was popular in Paris. YouTubers took it up and decided to show it off, resulting in its position as a Fortnite dance.</p><h3>3. Floss dance</h3><p></p><p class=align-left>The flossing dance, which is one of the most recent popular emotes, is doing rounds online. It involves a weird looking movement of the arms and was invented with Russell Horning who is best known as the 'Backpack Kid. It was after his invitation by Ketty Perry that he became popular. A lot of people took to it, and it soon became an overnight sensation.</p><h3>4. Turk's Dance</h3><p></p><p class=align-left>It was the genesis of Fortnite dances considering that it was the first people saw on Battle Royale. The dance was extracted from the comedy show 'Scrubs' when Turk did this dance in one of the episodes. Epic games picked it up and ran with it, making it popular. It is also called dance moves and is the Fortnite default dance that you would expect every player to know about. It is old school in nature too.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e3ffa2bd4fd6a829.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>These funny Star Wars memes will make you laugh</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Sefa - Shuga ft. Dope Nation: video, reactions</p><h3>5. Fresh Dance</h3><p></p><p class=align-left>The name says it all. The dance is of a character named Carlton from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. The well-known character is a nerd that dances rather strangely. The actor of the character recreated the dance on Dancing With The Stars where he took the competition's prize.</p><h3>6. Robot dance</h3><p></p><p class=align-left>Of all Fortnite dances, the robot one seems to be the easiest to identify with. It is a famous street dance where the person dancing makes jerky moves in response to the music beats. Even though it has been around for decades and maybe it can be said to have existed from when music was created, it is Michael Jackson that popularized it.</p><h3>7. Flapper dance</h3><p class=align-left>Have you wondered about how to dance in Fortnite? Try out the flapper dance, a tame dance of the 1920s. It was invented even before World War II, and its real name is actually The Charlston which was the song it was first danced to.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c7ef7333ec280396.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rema - Dumebi latest hit song takes the internet by storm</span></p></a><h3>8. Orange justice</h3><p></p><p class=align-left>This emote was released in Season 4 Battle Pass. It was discovered after the BoogieDown contest were participants submitted their own dances and the best would be added to the game. A kid with an orange shirt submitted his dance but did not win. After petition and signatures to reverse this, he finally got his justice, and the dance turned into an emote, marking the justice for the boy.</p><h3>9. Llama Bell</h3><p></p><p class=align-left>With the Clang! Clang! Clang! sound of the cowbell, everything seems better. It is this fantastic emote beats that make it unique. Its cowbell syncs with music, which makes it both a done and instrument emote. The music also gets catchy.</p><h3>10. Jubilation</h3><p></p><p class=align-left>This dance counts when going through the biggest as well as the most exciting time in life. The emote's basis is on the Seinfeld episode where Jerry goes to open the door for a super excited Elaine who is doing the jubilation dance. All the others try to join in, but it is clear that there is no one big enough to match Julia Louis-Dreyfus as her energy is exceptional. What better way to celebrate your victory royale than through this dance!</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7c1933b241bea71d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mr Eazi - Let Me Live My Life was a show stopper at Coachella</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Fortnite dances come in different varieties.
