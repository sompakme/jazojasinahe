Thankfully, director Andy Muschietti has been delivering the reveals on his <a href=#>Instagram</a>. We have already seen peeks at the <a href=#>Flashâ€™s outfit</a> and a very familiar <a href=#>Batman costume</a>. Now, he has decided to give us our first glimpse of what the new Supergirl will be wearing when she teams up with these other DC superheroes.</p><p>Check out our first look at the Sasha Calle Supergirl outfit right here:</p><p>One of the first things to note is that the Sasha Calle Supergirl symbol is extremely similar to the one we saw Henry Cavill wear during his tenure as the Man of Steel. For a comparison, check out his insignia here:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Christopher-Reeves-Henry-Cavill-Superman-1280x720-1-900x506.jpg><p>While it is not a one-to-one exact copy, it does look like Sasha Calle will be wearing a similar sigil as Henry Cavill did. This leads us to wonder a few things: is this Supergirl going to be from the established <a href=#>DC Extended Universe</a>? If so, that is definitely a major reveal that will require some serious backstory. There have been some potential <a href=#>teases</a> in the Zack Snyder movies about other Kryptonians being alive, so it is a total possibility that this will be one of the major revelations in The Flash.</p><p>However, we also know that The Flash is going to be experimenting with <a href=#>multiverse</a> worlds. So, Sasha Calle could also be a version of Supergirl from another universe. Now, that alternate universe could share some strong similarities to the DC Extended Universe, so it does not necessarily have to be a radical departure. Could she be from a world where she was the prime survivor of <a href=#>Krypton</a>? That would be a fun twist and would leave the door open for her to star in her own movie down the road.</p><p>As far as aesthetics go, this Sasha Calle Supergirl outfit does an interesting thing where it looks like the cape portion will be more heavily integrated into the full costume. From the top half of the insignia upward, it looks like the iconic red cape will blend into the costume in a really cool way. It gives the costume an even stronger and distinct color palette from other Superman and Supergirl costumes. We are fans of it!</p><p>Hopefully, director Andy Muchietti will continue to follow this up with an even greater reveal of Sasha Calle as Supergirl. These little costume teases have been fun but fans want to see the whole shebang. Are we going to have to wait for the first footage to be released to get that? Or will they be shown on social media like these teases? Whatever the case may be, these are getting us wicked excited for The Flash. That November 4, 2022 release date needs to get here sooner rather than later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2irkai1onnCmqOlnV2owrGx0aCgq6RdmLy0wNSmnGegpKK5</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
