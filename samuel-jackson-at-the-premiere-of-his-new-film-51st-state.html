The American star was in London’s Mayfair for the first night of <i>51st State,</i> in which he stars as a streetwise US chemist about to set up his last big illicit substances deal and introduce a new designer drug to the European market.</p><p id=eHthfbiTPcb data-wc=59>But the <i>Pulp Fiction</i> star admitted he had not gone “commando”, and was wearing woolly briefs beneath the garment. “I’m not wearing it – how do you say? – 'Scottish-style' tonight,” he said. “I was banking on this role, due to the fact that in the script it made clear that the character would have to wear a kilt.”</p><p id=e36cu6xM-kb data-wc=62>The film’s screenwriter, Stel Pavlou, also turned up in a kilt for his movie’s debut.
