"It was a privilege to be able to play George in general,"&nbsp;he told the outlet. "He is a man, affliction aside, who has a wide spectrum of behavior, which, as an actor is amazing. I think it was brilliant, not only to be able to explore his health and the pain that he individually experiences and the misery that he individually experiences, but also how that affected the main narrative, which is the love story and how their love finds ways—like running water, evade and keep flowing."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6W8dYQDdR7F7uMY3fnCTAT-1920-80.jpg><h2 id=reg-xe9-jean-page-xa0-and-jonathan-bailey-gave-him-advice-for-his-role-3>Regé-Jean Page&nbsp;and Jonathan Bailey gave him advice for his role.</h2><p>In a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/queen-charlotte-corey-mylchreest-rege-jean-page-advice-rcna82759 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Today</a> interview, Mylchreest revealed the advice he received from the Bridgerton season 1 and 2 stars, as they passed the Bridgerverse-heartthrob baton. He summarized Page's advice as, "Anything that's outside out the stuff that will help you between action and cut doesn't exist, and everything that will help you, it does. Let that stuff in, but everything else, just let it slide off you."</p><p>Mylchreest also said that he had "quite a few conversations" with Jonathan Bailey, admitting that all the advice "would take a long time to sum up."</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

When asked if he'd seen Bridgerton before his role on the show, he<br>admitted that he had never seen the global hit. "It just sort of passed me by. I don’t know how. I guess maybe I’m not the demographic," he explained. He then added, "I was told not to watch it, to try not to emulate any of the performances. And as soon as I got the job, I was like, 'Alright, I gotta binge this thing.' I sat down with my girlfriend and we did the whole shebang."</p><p>As for his Instagram, Mylchreest has mostly posted behind-the-scenes and red carpet pics from Queen Charlotte, with captions showing his sense of humor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJulocG2vsRoq69lo528uL%2BOsJ%2BoZZmoeqS70Z6wZqWpobCpvsSeqq1lqaTCr7OMpKCnn12csrC%2Bxp5kqq2Vmrtur8eaqaWnpKmycA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
