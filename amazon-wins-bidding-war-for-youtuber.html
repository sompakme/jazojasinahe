It will feature 1,000 contestants competing for a $5 million cash payout. The prize is touted as the biggest single prize in the history of television and streaming.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Sources say Amazon outbid at least one major streaming rival to make the deal with MrBeast, a.k.a. Jimmy Donaldson, who is the most popular content creator on YouTube. Donaldson also negotiated the right to retain creative control of the production.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“My goal is to make the greatest show possible and prove YouTubers and creators can succeed on other platforms,” said MrBeast in a statement. “Amazon gave me the creative control I need to try and make it happen. I hope to make the YouTube community proud.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">MrBeast will serve as the show’s host and an executive producer for the show, which will stream on Prime Video. He’ll also continue to make his YouTube series.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“MrBeast has captured the attention and imagination of fans of all ages, from all walks of life, and all over the world,” said Jennifer Salke, head of Amazon MGM Studios. “We are excited to work with Jimmy and his talented&nbsp;team to bring his brilliant, high production, and stakes-raising concepts to Beast Games for our global customers to experience.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Previously, the first season Netflix’s Squid Games: The Challenge <a href=#>set the record</a> for biggest reality TV payout with its $4.56 million prize.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Donaldson has been creating YouTube content since 2016 and has a whopping 245 million subscribers to his channel. He has created nearly 800 videos, many of which are high-end productions — such as his <a href=# rel=nofollow>real-life Squid Game contest</a>, for example, which racked up 588 million views. His family-friendly videos typically feature stunts and acts of philanthropy, such as paying for cataract surgeries to help 1,000 blind people see again. He’s given away millions in food and supplies for those in need. He’s built his own studio for creating content, a $10 million facility in North Carolina.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In February, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Donaldson told Time magazine</a> that his channel brings in $600 million to $700 million per year, which is re-invested back into his productions. “Each video does a couple million in ad revenue, a couple million in brand deals,” Donaldson said. “I’ve reinvested everything to the point of — you could claim —stupidity, just believing that we would succeed. And it’s worked out … I just want to be the best and I want to make the best content possible.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOpqlmmpWWwLV5069krJ2inrK0ecCmmLOnnmLGsMHTrpmeZWFngHaElG1tbGlf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
