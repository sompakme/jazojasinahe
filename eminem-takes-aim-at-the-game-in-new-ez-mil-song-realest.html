The Game took some shots at Eminem on his 2022 album, Drillmatic Heart vs. Mind. "I never heard you in a club, I never heard you in a bar / Eleven albums and ten never got played inside of my car," he raps on his 10-minute diss track <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"The Black Slim Shady."</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It's clear that Eminem has come back with a vengeance on his latest feature, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">responding directly</a> to The Game's diss. "All the envious rappers I'd torch if I'm on a joint with 'em / And that is the only retort is I'm not played in the clubs muthaf*cka put a cork in it / Only reason they still play your sh*t in the clubs / (Why?) is 'cause you still perform in 'em," he raps.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-eminem-says-the-game-still-performs-in-clubs>Eminem Says The Game Still Performs In Clubs</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Ez Mil just <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">recently signed to Shady Records</a>, as well as Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. The 25-year-old was the first to sign to all three since <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>50 Cent</a> did it in 2002. Obviously, a collab with Eminem is huge, especially for an up and coming artist. In press release last month, Eminem revealed why he had his eye on Ez Mil in the first place.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">We’ve never been out there signing a lot of artists</a>, and one of the great things about how we built Shady is how selective we’ve been,” he explained. “And it’s even rarer that Dre and I sign something together." He continued, "but I heard Ez’s music and was like, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">‘this is really special’</a> so I took it to Dre. We both agreed it would be a great fit and we wanted to work with him right on the spot.” <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Dr. Dre</a> also went on to praise the artist, saying “Em played me Ez and I had that feeling.”</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Caroline Fisher is a News Writer at HotNewHipHop from Chicago, Illinois.
