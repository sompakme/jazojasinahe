Her Majesty was like many of us when it came to her favourite dessert though, with a penchant for chocolate.</p><p id=erhOsL8ExknU data-wc=7><strong>WATCH: The Queen - what will change</strong></p><p id=ecwbvL3BnlqT data-wc=25>Darren told us: "She is absolutely a chocoholic.

She loved using ingredients off the estate and so if we had salmon from Balmoral from the River Dee, she'd have that, it was one of her favourites. We used a repertoire of dishes, mainly British and French food. We cooked a lot of traditional French food like halibut on a bed of spinach with a Morney sauce."</p><p id=exmyw8v4uJYU data-wc=80>The chef&nbsp;added: "But the Queen never was a foodie. She always ate to live rather than live to eat. Prince Philip was the foodie. He'd want to try any new dishes all the time and got excited about new ingredients, whereas the Queen, if we had a new recipe, she'd have to look at the whole recipe before saying, 'Yes ok let's try it'. But for the most part she stuck to the same dishes week in week out."</p><p id=eu9KjUkteusq data-wc=2><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Philip's most memorable quotes and witty one-liners</a>str</strong></p><p id=edRVtkrd-6Ai data-wc=1><strong>PHOTOS:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Royals' favourite takeaways: from Prince William to Kate Middleton and more</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3a94f9c75347-queen-drink-z.jpg><p id=enbYJnXh8X5P data-wc=13><strong>Despite travelling all over the world, the Queen&nbsp;is not an adventurous eater</strong></p><p id=ePv6pmv6IDkD data-wc=24>A red leather-bound book of menus, written in French, would be sent up to the Queen each week, containing a wide variety of recipes.</p><p id=ec3JWHaDM_0j data-wc=63>"We prepared the menus three days ahead so we could get the food in," said Darren. <strong>"The chefs would pick the menus and she would put a line through the ones she didn't want. </strong>Sometimes she'd put a line through it all and put something different, like if she was having dinner with Prince Andrew, his favourite was crème brulee with Sandringham oranges.</p><p id=epsCTVPDW737 data-wc=28>"It's like any mum with a son or grandson coming home. If <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince William</a> was coming for tea it would be a chocolate biscuit cake.

It was everything I expected it to be. They have the most amazing produce, the best quality food, the best ingredients to work with. Just little things like picking up the phone and calling Harrods and asking for a rack of lamb with a two-inch eye of meat and six bones – you got everything you wanted."</p><p id=eA6sOiFiAwn4 data-wc=70>Darren trained in his hometown of Nottingham and worked at The Savoy in London, but he decided to apply for a job at the palace after camping out on the Mall on the eve of <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Charles</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Diana</a>'s wedding. It was then that he thought how "amazing" it would be to work in the royal kitchens, and a few weeks later he went in for an interview and secured a job.</p><p id=elaZqxqVYhql data-wc=22><strong>Make sure you never miss a ROYAL story! <a class=hm-link href=#>Sign up to our newsletter</a> to get all of our celebrity and royal news delivered directly to your inbox.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmMKqv8innGhqYGd%2FcYWQcmhuaWVnhXC91J6cp2WVoba7rcGeq6FlYWZ6p63VqKyroaSaeqe7zp1m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
