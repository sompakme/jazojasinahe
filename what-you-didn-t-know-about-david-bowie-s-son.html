According to The Baltimore Sun, she agreed to give up custody of their son, Duncan Jones, and was awarded $750,000 in the settlement. The agreement&nbsp;included a 10-year gag order that prevented her from saying anything about her ex-husband. Once those ten years were up, however, Barnett unleashed a lot of hate over the alleged circumstances surrounding their split.&nbsp;</p><p>She talked about why she gave up custody of her son with <a href=#>Evening Standard</a>&nbsp;in 2005. "I just didn't want to get into a pissing match with David about custody. I really thought the best thing to keep David alive was to leave my son with him. It was the hardest thing I've ever done," she said. "...I kept saying to myself, I've got to do this. I can't escape if I take my child with me, he'll fight me and it will be awful for my son. And I can have another child, it's not a big deal."</p><p>In 2016,&nbsp;Barnett appeared on the reality show&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity Big Brother</a>&nbsp;and dredged up more family drama,&nbsp;claiming she and Duncan hadn't spoken in 30 years because he hated her, thanks to Bowie.&nbsp;</p><p>Jones has kept his&nbsp;<a href=#>thoughts on the matter private</a>&nbsp;in recent years. He told the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>&nbsp;in 2011, "We stopped communicating when I was 13 and it was the right choice then and I'm convinced it's still the right choice now."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWxmboNwsMidpa1lm6O8uHnDmq2inF2XvLi1xKxkrKeeZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
