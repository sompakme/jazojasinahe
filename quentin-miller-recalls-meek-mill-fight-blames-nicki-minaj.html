These days, the 32-year old artist is focused on his own music and doesn't talk much about <a href=# class=text-word rel>Drake</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# class=text-word rel>Meek Mill</a> or any of the parties involved in the infamous "Back To Back" beef --- until now.&nbsp;</p><p>During a sit down with&nbsp;Rory & Mal, Quentin recalled the time he&nbsp;was approached by Meek's Dreamchasers crew in Los Angeles,&nbsp;<a href=# rel>which lead to him getting beat up</a> for not confirming that he was Drake's ghostwriter. "They come into the store. He says all his s*** like, ‘You making me look crazy,'” Miller shared. “He’s like, ‘I can tell you ain’t on no street shit, so I ain’t gon do nothing.’ So I’m like, ‘Iight.’ And he just does a quick turnaround. I’m thinking we good and his man’s came back in with the camera."&nbsp;</p><p>The "Stuck Up" rapper says <a href=# class=text-word rel>Nicki Minaj</a>, who was <a href=# rel>Meek's girlfriend at the time of the incident</a>, is the one to blame for the fight. Quentin claims it was the "Super Freaky Girl" rapper&nbsp;that put the battery in Meek's back to fight&nbsp;him, suggesting that she told the Dreamchasers frontman, "Nah, run that." "Listen, I’m a Nicki fan," Quentin added. "my daughter’s a Nicki fan, but that was f**** up, man! If that was the case… Just finding that out, that hurt even more. Like I’ve never had a conversation with this lady, why she doing that?”</p><p>Six years later, and not much has changed since the Drake vs. Meek debacle. The 6 God and Dream Chaser have rekindled their friendship, Nicki and Drake are on good terms and Quentin is back to making music he loves.
