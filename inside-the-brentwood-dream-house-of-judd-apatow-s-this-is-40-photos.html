Apatow lives just up the street (“Our kids are friends,” says Zuriff), and the director had used their pad as the home of Rudd and Mann’s characters in 2007’s Knocked Up. In This Is 40, the couple must put their house up for sale.</p><p><a href=#><strong>PHOTOS: Inside the ‘This Is 40’ Dream House</strong></a></p><p>Apatow personally called the Zuriffs to ask about shooting there again. “We negotiated a deal,” says Zuriff, an executive producer on Showtime’s upcoming drama Ray Donovan. (He declined comment on how much the production paid.)</p><p>How Apatow first found the house is a Hollywood small-town story. “My sister-in-law is <strong>Giuliana Rancic</strong>, and in Knocked Up, <strong>Katherine Heigl</strong> played a character like her, and they went to E! to scout. The producers couldn’t find a house, and Giuliana was like, ‘You should call my brother-in-law,’” recalls Zuriff, a former spec builder who had just completed the house for himself.</p><p><strong><a href=#>THR COVER:&nbsp;The Angsty Existence of Judd Apatow</a></strong></p><p>With the Zuriffs’ belongings in storage, the filmmakers took over the house for six weeks. Pope and production designer <strong>Jefferson Sage</strong> redecorated to suit the fictional family, which has two daughters. They decided on a palette of greens, corals and melons. “You want it to be fun and vibrant,” says Pope. “That’s shorthand that this is a family with a lot of life.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKq60qKbnmWSp7KvwNaopp1llKeyormMoaauq5Vit7aww2ZramlgZ35w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
