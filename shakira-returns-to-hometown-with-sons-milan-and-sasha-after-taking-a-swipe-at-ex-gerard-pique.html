Dubbed The Boss, according to reports, it seems to echo the alleged nickname Gerard's friends used for her: La Patron, which translates to The Boss.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c80a49d116c1-gettyimages-1669975102.jpg><p id=eSSRvbjL6zX data-wc=17>The moniker was rumored to be a reference to her perceived dominant personality during their time together.</p><p id=emrB7laRKFi data-wc=24>If so, it's not first time she's used her music as a platform for voicing her feelings towards her ex and his new relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/335c77a119cb-gettyimages-1661074238.jpg><p id=etrdcT5RhZn data-wc=31>At the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards held on Tuesday, Shakira performed what many have dubbed a 'diss track', titled Shakira Bzrp Music Sessions 53, which was released earlier in January.</p><p id=eXz8O4Rg0jt data-wc=64>Lyrics from the track like 'A lot of gyms. But work your brain a little bit too' and 'I'm worth two 22's. You traded a Ferrari for a Twingo. You traded a Rolex for a Casio' certainly seem pointed. Yet, it was her line 'She's got the name of a good person. Clearly is not how it sounds' that sent fans into a tizzy.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/45fd0e08f12b-gettyimages-1517279970.jpg><p id=euTqLU7Md62 data-wc=36>Many believe 'Clearly', which translates to 'Claramente' in Spanish, to be an evident nod to Clara.
