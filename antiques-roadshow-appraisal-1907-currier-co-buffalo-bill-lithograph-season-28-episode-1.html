Hm?</p><p>GUEST: Yeah, very subdued, yeah.</p><p>APPRAISER: Almost funereal, right?</p><p>GUEST: Uh-huh.</p><p>APPRAISER: So I thought, "Oh, maybe this is a posthumous print."</p><p>GUEST: Mm-hmm.</p><p>APPRAISER: But then you look at it and it says "Yours, cordially," you know, "Colonel W.F.</p><p>Cody (Buffalo Bill)."</p><p>So it's while he's still alive.</p><p>And then I looked cl, more closely, and it's really faint, but in the lower right hand corner, you can see that it was printed by the Currier Litho Company in Buffalo, New York, and it's dated 1907.</p><p>GUEST: Okay.</p><p>APPRAISER: So this is a 1907 lithograph.</p><p>And, and Bill, although... You know, he died in 1917.</p><p>By 1907, his career was not as large as it had been a, a few years prior to that.</p><p>GUEST: Mm-hmm.</p><p>APPRAISER: But he was still performing.</p><p>What do you think this is worth?</p><p>GUEST: I tried to get it appraised once, and it wa, they said it was anywhere from $200 to, it could be more.</p><p>APPRAISER: That's a very general appraisal.</p><p>GUEST: Yeah.</p><p>(chuckles) APPRAISER: (laughs) GUEST: It was.</p><p>But we just, I love it, and, uh, it's been a part of the family forever.</p><p>APPRAISER: I think that if this were to come to auction without the printer's mark on it...</p><p>GUEST: Uh-huh.</p><p>APPRAISER: ...people wouldn't have the actual historical context, the date in which it came from.</p><p>GUEST: Mm-hmm.</p><p>APPRAISER: And I think having the Currier Lithograph mark on it and the date 1907 really helps add that extra level of, of context, authenticity, and value.</p><p>If this was Bill on his horse...</p><p>GUEST: Uh-huh.</p><p>APPRAISER: ...if this was Bill in a fictitious recreation of some famous battle that he did...</p><p>GUEST: Mm-hmm.</p><p>APPRAISER: ...it might have some extra appeal.</p><p>GUEST: Mm-hmm.</p><p>APPRAISER: Buffalo Bill really is one of the, still one of the top marquee names in collectibles.</p><p>GUEST: Mm-hmm.</p><p>APPRAISER: At auction, I would estimate it between $4,000 and $6,000.</p><p>GUEST: Okay.</p><p>Well, thank you.</p><p>It's going to still have a, its favorite place at my house.</p><p>(laughs) APPRAISER: And it's one of those things, because it's so rare, it wouldn't surprise me if it went even higher.</p><p>GUEST: Uh-huh.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sa7SZ6arn1%2BrtqWxzmiYqaiilra0rctmaHJoZ2Kwtr7RopyrZZOkeqPBxZ%2BYpaddl7atuIyloK2gn5y%2ForzHZq%2Btp5%2BdtXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
