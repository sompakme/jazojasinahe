The couple had been married for 11 years when they publicly announced their split in a joint statement. "We remain best friends and responsible parents to our daughter [Coco Riley Arquette] and we still love each other deeply. As we go though this process we are determined to use kindness and understanding to get through this together." At the time of the trial separation, Arquette's acting career had slowed significantly, while Cox was starring in not one, but two TV shows: Dirt and Cougar Town.</p><p>Back in the day, Arquette had received top billing in more than his fair share of big films, such as Never Been Kissed (1999), Muppets From Space (1999), 3000 Miles to Graceland&nbsp;(2001),&nbsp;See Spot Run (2001) and Eight Legged Freaks (2002). By the time his marriage began crumbling, he'd been mostly relegated to supporting character roles, such as his minor recurring part in TV's Pushing Daisies (2007-2009). It took two years for &nbsp;Cox and Arquette to begin divorce proceedings, but their marriage officially ended in 2013. Interestingly enough, Cox invited her estranged husband to guest-star on her show, Cougar Town, in 2012, proving there truly were no hard feelings between them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmam9kbH5ww8eaq56ulad6qa3PqZynnZRisaLCyJ1kmqqhqrK1wMRo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
