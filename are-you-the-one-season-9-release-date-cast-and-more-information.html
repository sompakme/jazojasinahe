Another reason why the show may have taken such a long break appears to be because of serious allegations made against the show's producers as Gianna Hammer. Hammer, a contestant on Season 5, alleged to <a href=#>Daily Beast</a> in 2021 that, while filming in the Dominican Republic, she was given medication by three producers she didn't feel she should have mixed with alcohol and was sexually assaulted by a cast member. She also shared her alleged experience on <a href=#>TikTok</a>.</p><p>Daily Beast also spoke to other cast members who appeared on season five who corroborated parts of Gianna's story, though production company Lighthearted Entertainment told the outlet, "We are confident that any review will confirm the safety procotols [sic] that we have long had in place on the sets of 'Are You The One?.' We deny the allegations made by the former contestant; throughout the eight seasons of the show, no contestant has reported an incident of sexual assault to Lighthearted."</p><p>MTV added in a statement, "We take these issues very seriously and have paused production/casting to conduct an independent investigation into the allegations, the third-party production company and further review our internal safety protocols."</p><p>If you or anyone you know has been a victim of sexual assault, help is available. Visit the <a href=#>Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network website</a> or contact RAINN's National Helpline at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcGtgZ4V3e8CrnGaxn6p6tbTEZqannV2osqK%2FzqdkcmWimrmmrdKeZJ2ZpJp6pK3SrWSappRiurC%2BxGagp56fp7qiwMiopWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
