"For all my marriage with Meri, I felt like she unloads her emotions into a burden that I'm supposed to carry,"&nbsp;the dad of <a href=#>18 biological and adopted kids</a> said.&nbsp;"I'm not carrying this burden, because there's no reason that I should." Then, he&nbsp;dropped the bombshell.</p><p>"I haven't put effort into that relationship specifically because I have three other relationships that are rewarding and wholesome, with children that need me and with children that need to see me," Kody explains in the shocking preview. It appears as if his relationships with the <a href=#>other Sister Wives</a> Janelle, Christine, and Robyn have taken priority over Meri and their daughter, Mariah.</p><p>As far as Meri's concerned, she has already let Kody know where she stands. She says that she has left the "ball in his court," which is interesting because Kody then claims that neither he nor Meri sees value in their relationship anymore.</p><p>Those who have followed the exploits of the Sister Wives know that <a href=#>Kody and Meri Brown's relationship is complicated</a>. She was Kody's first wife and they have one daughter together. She was his <a href=#>only legal spouse until 2014</a> when he opted to divorce her to legally marry Robyn Brown because he wanted to adopt his fourth wife's children. It sounds like this already-complicated relationship just got even more complicated.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGxjaoV3e9ahsGallae2bq7RqK6nq12nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1uw8itn2ajn5nGbrXSZpqopaChsrWxy7JkqK6Vp3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
