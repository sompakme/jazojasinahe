"[The] rest of the cast [and] the guest actors had to do the same line-readings to Lucy every time so she could get her timing," Sandrich said, according to <a href=#>CheatSheet</a>. A slightly different take on a line could throw off the energy of the scene, she thought.</p><p dir=ltr>Worse rumors about her behavior exist as well. There are stories of her slapping her makeup artist, throwing scripts on the floor, and even taking the fake eyelashes off of another actress, saying "Nobody wears false eyelashes on this show but me!", according to <a href=#>The Daily Mail</a>. And after Ball lambasted the actor Richard Burton for mumbling his lines on the set of her '60s sitcom "The Lucy Show," he wrote in his diary that "She is a monster of staggering charmlessness and monumental lack of humour."</p><p dir=ltr>Even if Ball could be rigid on set, there's no doubt her work paid off. She supposedly did the <a href=#>famous Vitameatavegamin scene in one take</a>, which wasn't uncommon for her. Could Richard Burton do that?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDkG1oa3BfrLWiwIylrJyhnKGybq7ApaOsZZ%2BjerSx02aZnqCRq7awvoywmKxlopqurbjYZqOio5Vk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
