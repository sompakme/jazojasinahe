Bong-sun (Park), is an extremely shy woman who has trouble making friends and harbors a secret crush on Sun-woo (Jo Jung-suk), the star chef at the restaurant where she works. She's also the granddaughter of a shaman, who can occasionally see ghosts. It's only when she encounters Sun-ae, the ghost of a lustful virgin, that she becomes fully possessed. As her mousy personality suddenly changes, she catches the eye of Sun-woo.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.amazon.com/Oh-My-Ghost-Eps-1/dp/B094CRYHD9/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=korean+drama&qid=1692823869&s=instant-video&sr=1-5" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FOh-My-Ghost-Eps-1%2Fdp%2FB094CRYHD9%2Fref%3Dsr_1_5%3Fkeywords%3Dkorean%2Bdrama%26qid%3D1692823869%26s%3Dinstant-video%26sr%3D1-5%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id=1471 data-merchant-url=amazon.com data-merchant-network=Amazon>WATCH NOW</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJulocG2vsRomZ6rpGK4sL7EmqVmnKKWuqK%2FjKilZpmdlsewuoypqaKllWLDqrDEqGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
