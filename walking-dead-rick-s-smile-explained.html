In their search, the group winds up encountering a mysterious group of well armed people and Rick, completely surrounded and held at gunpoint, bursts into the most bizarre smile. As a viewer, it’s almost jarring to see the beleaguered former sheriff smile in any situation, let alone one as dire as this. But to hear Walking Dead <span data-scayt_word=showrunner data-scaytid=8>showrunner</span> Scott M. <span data-scayt_word=Gimple data-scaytid=9>Gimple</span> tell it, there’s a method to Rick’s seeming madness.</p><p>“That smile has a lot to do with the next episode.

There’s tough stuff in the next episode but there’s straight up fun and attempts are made at humor from the situation that these characters get in. A whole new world is discovered. It’s a cool turn of the story.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>To hear that this crew is an “answer” should be seen as good news for the Grimes gang, who are desperate for well trained (and armed) soldiers as they prepare to take on <span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=12>Negan</span> and his seemingly endless group of Saviors.
