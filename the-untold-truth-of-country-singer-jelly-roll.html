They married in 2016, after dating for about a year. One night while in Las Vegas, the Nashville rapper popped the question to the former sex worker â€” while he was onstage at a Deftones concert. After the concert, he decided they should get hitched right then and there. "I'm like, 'F*** it, let's just go now.' She's like, 'The courthouse is open for like ... 44 more minutes," he said in a <a href=#>TikTok video</a>, revealing they each said "I do" just before midnight.</p><p>At the time that <a href=#>he and Bunnie tied the knot</a>, Jelly Roll's life was a far cry from what it would become. "I was&nbsp;a lost cause, I was in the middle of custody battle, I was broke, living out of van doing 200 shows a year for $200 a show," he wrote in an <a href=#>Facebook</a> tribute to his spouse. As he explained, she quite literally turned his life around. "It was truly the turning point in my career and life,"&nbsp;he added, crediting Bunnie with helping him get custody of daughter Bailee Ann.&nbsp;</p><p>Bunnie, however, wasn't content to merely be the wife of a successful country-rap star, and forged her own identity with the launch of her "Dumb Blonde Podcast."&nbsp;Among the various guests she's interviewed have been Jelly Roll himself, who appeared in a June 2020 episode.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtoZoF2g46upa2nnJl6tb7UrZ9mopWhubp50aijpWWTpMKvwNGyZKyhnpyys3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
