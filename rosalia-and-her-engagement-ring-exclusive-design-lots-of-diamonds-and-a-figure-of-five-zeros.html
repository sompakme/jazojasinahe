The end of the video clip of 'Beso', released at midnight last night, went around the world because of the image it contained in the form of news. <strong>Rosalia</strong>, crying "with mascara running", held in her hand an engagement ring box which she was already wearing on her finger.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>This is Rosalia's ring: It's worth 600,000 euros!</h2><p>A spectacular ring with a classic cut, the opposite of the singer's current style.

Specifically, in June, where <strong>Rosalia </strong>uploaded a photo to Instagram embracing <strong>Rauw Alejandro</strong>, who had his back turned. On the artist's hand, you can see the same diamond ring.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/e00-marca.uecdn.es/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2023/03/24/16796747065097.jpg><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>The other more mediatic rings</h2><p>Within the music industry we have to talk about the most famous marriages and the most expensive rings. The list is led, of course, by <strong>Beyonce </strong>and <strong>Jay-Z</strong>.

It cost five million euros.</p><p><strong>Jennifer Lopez </strong>and <strong>Ben Affleck </strong>got married and the singer wore a Harry Winston ring, whose price was around 1.2 million dollars. <strong>Kate Middleton</strong>, meanwhile, wore a 500,000 dollar ring, a gift from her husband <strong>Prince William</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqWgn52jqcatsY6mrKyhk2R%2FcX6SaGdsZ2JqfHeAkJ9qbZ1iZ393fJCdbnJtYG2vdYGXbWWhrJ2h</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
