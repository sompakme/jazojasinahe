Although Stewart wasn't the biggest Barbie kid growing up (she played with more "Weird Barbie"-like toys), she became "obsessed" with the Barbie movie. In fact, she even cried during leading man <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ryan Gosling's viral performance</a> at the Academy Awards. During this week's episode of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Not Skinny But Not Fat&nbsp;podcast</a> (which was recorded a day after Hollywood's biggest night), Stewart gushed about the record-breaking film and Gosling's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>beloved performance</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Oscars were incredible last night.
