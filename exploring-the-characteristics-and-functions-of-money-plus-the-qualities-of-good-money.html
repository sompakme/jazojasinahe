Various characteristics of money make it powerful and worth working hard for in today's world.</p><h2>Characteristics of money</h2><p class=align-left>Have you ever thought about the characteristics of <a href=#>money in economics</a>? Well, there have been many forms of money in history.</p><p class=align-left>Some forms have worked better than others because they have characteristics that make them more useful. Learn more below.</p><h3>What is money?</h3><p class=align-left>It is important to know what money is before looking at its characteristics. In simple terms, money is a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">medium of exchange</a> that allows people and businesses to obtain what they need to live and thrive.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5d1e4a1b5a31a4d5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ballgowns, surveillance and cloning for sale at China pet fair</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Did you know money is an intangible concept while <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">currency is a tangible</a> concept? The coins and bills people carry are <a href=#>currency</a>, not technically money.</p><p class=align-left>In the past, precious metals, including silver and gold, were <a href=#>powerful tools</a> of exchange. In the contemporary world, money has become far more intangible. It is mainly defined by the functions it <a href=#>can</a> fulfil.</p><h3>Types of money</h3><p class=align-left>Money is something determined by market participants to have value and be exchangeable. As a result, there are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">different types of money</a> in the market, as explored below.</p><ul><li><strong>Commodity money: </strong>This is a good that can be used as money. It is a medium exchange with intrinsic value because of its use for purposes other than money, e.g., silver and gold.</li><li><strong>Commercial banks money: </strong>This is money created in an economy through debt issued by commercial banks. Banks normally take client deposits into savings accounts and then loan part of it to other clients to create more money.</li><li><strong>Fiat money: </strong>This is a medium of exchange backed by the government and nothing else. Its value comes from a government decree that officially recognises it as a medium of exchange.</li><li><strong>Fiduciary money: </strong>This is a form of money where parties accept something as a medium of exchange in a transaction. It is not recognised as a legal tender by the government, and people are not obligated to accept it as a form of payment under the law.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/73d16561243b5eee.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bank of Ireland apologises for 'free money' tech glitch</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5d1e4a1b5a31a4d5.jpg><h3>What are the characteristics of money?</h3><p class=align-left>There are several characteristics or <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">qualities of good money</a>, as explored below.</p><h4><strong>Durability</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Durability means money must be a thing of continued use. A cow is fairly durable if used as a medium of exchange. However, a long trip to the market comes with the risk of sickness or death, which can severely reduce its value. Therefore, a cow is not a durable medium of exchange.</p><p class=align-left>For paper money that is commonly used, it must be resistant to wear and tear over time. In today's world, online transactions are common.</p><h4><strong>Portability</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Good money should be easy to move from one point to another. Coins and banknotes are easier to carry than a cow (as used in the previous explanation).</p><h4><strong>General acceptability</strong></h4><p class=align-left>General acceptability means that the form of currency must be generally distributed, and people accept it without any hesitation. People cannot accept a medium of exchange that cannot be put into circulation later.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8f79e36fde210a44.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"Turn ATM Off": Error in banking services allows customers with no money in their account to withdraw N833k</span></p></a><h4><strong>Divisibility</strong></h4><p class=align-left>If someone wants to buy a smaller unit of a commodity, the divisibility of money can make it possible. <a href=#>In Nigeria</a>, for example, Naira notes come in denominations of ₦5, ₦10, ₦20, ₦50, ₦100, ₦200, ₦500, and ₦1000. ₦1 can also be broken down into kobo.</p><h4><strong>Homogeneity</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Money must be homogeneous. This means that two ₦200 notes must look and feel identical. They must also have the same value. If money is not homogeneous, transactions will become uncertain.</p><h4><strong>Stability</strong></h4><p class=align-left>The value of a good medium of exchange should change for a long period of time. It should remain stable. If its value keeps changing, it will fail to function as a measure of value.</p><h4><strong>Cognoscibility</strong></h4><p class=align-left>A good medium of exchange should be recognisable, i.e., people should be able to identify it from previous encounters or knowledge. If it is not cognisable, people will find it challenging to determine if they are dealing with money or another inferior asset.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1203a8a52a3a17f7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Yellen calls for diversified clean energy supply chains</span></p></a><h4><strong>Scarcity</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Money must be scarce or <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">limited in supply</a>. The more money is seen around in the hands of people, the more it gradually loses value. This is the reason the currency of some countries has a higher value than the currency of other countries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/73d16561243b5eee.jpg><h3>Functions of money</h3><p class=align-left>There are multiple functions or uses of money in today's world. These uses are explored below.</p><ul><li><strong>Medium of exchange of items of value: </strong>This is the primary function of money. People use it as a good worth exchanging various items of value, e.g., an adult male goat has a value of between ₦20k and ₦25k per kilogram if bought directly from farmers' markets.</li><li><strong>Unit of account:</strong> Money is used to keep track of changes in the value of items over a period. People often use it to compare the value of various goods and services. It is used to account for profits and losses, value the total assets of a firm, and balance budgets.</li><li><strong>Store of value: </strong>In most transactions, money is inherently future-oriented. It offers a way of storing monetary value for use in the future without the value deteriorating.</li><li><strong>Standard of deferred payment: </strong>Money is normally used to transfer value over different time periods in the form of credits and debts. People borrow money for an agreed-upon period of time and repay it with interest at a future date.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9a87e2f75ce90b7b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Belgian pilots strike, cancelling 88 Ryanair flights</span></p></a><h2>What is the definition of money?</h2><p class=align-left>Money refers to a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">medium of exchange</a> that is centralised, recognised, and generally accepted in a country or countries.
