I love it.” Eilish also discussed her body while reflecting on her gender identity and the way fans have sexualized her. “I have big boobs. I’ve had big boobs since I was nine years old, and that’s just the way I am. That’s how I look. You wear something that’s at all revealing, and everyone’s like, ‘Oh, but you didn’t want people to sexualize you?’” Of the trolls, she added: “You can suck my ass! I’m literally a being that is sexual sometimes. F*ck you!”</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Billie Eilish Co-Signs Lil Yachty’s NSFW Lyrics About Her From Drake’s Album</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-billie-eilish-performs-at-coachella>Billie Eilish Performs At Coachella</h2></span><p>INDIO, CALIFORNIA - APRIL 23: Billie Eilish performs on the Coachella stage during the 2022 Coachella Valley Music And Arts Festival on April 23, 2022 in Indio, California.

I’m attracted to them for real.” Despite this, she still has "deep connections with women in my life, the friends in my life, the family in my life. I’m physically attracted to them.
