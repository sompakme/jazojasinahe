Draymond, in a recent episode of <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">The Draymond Green Show</a>, labeled Skip as a “hater,” to which Skip responded by calling Draymond “the dirtiest player in NBA history.” Green, not one to back down, further criticized Bayless, stating, “Everybody’s skipping past Skip Bayless since Shannon left him, and he comes out and says he’ll have me eating out of the palm of his hands.”&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Draymond continued, “I am not coming on your show, Skip. I’m gonna keep skipping past you just like everyone else skipped on you, because that show is dead, nobody wants to hear you talk anymore. In the words of Richard Sherman, ‘I am better than you. I am better than you at life, I am just better at you.'” Green continues, displaying the rings and honors that envelop him, before concluding, "Yeah Skip, we don't respect you, you need more people," Echoing <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Jay-Z</a>’s “Takeover.”</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-draymond-green-fires-more-shots-at-skip-bayless>Draymond Green Fires More Shots At Skip Bayless</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In reaction to something <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Draymond Green had said about LeBron James,</a> Bayless had stated he wanted Green to appear on his show and discuss why he branded him a hater. Skip said, “Draymond can come right here on this show…he can have as much time as he wants to make all of his cases against me, but I will respond. Thats why Draymond will never join me on this show, he knows what would happen to him. I know too much and I’m not afraid to say it. He knows I would chew him up and spit him right out for all to see.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Bayless also said, “In my career, I have never seen anything like this phenomenon. Draymond Green is, no exaggeration, the dirtiest player in NBA history by far.” He continued, “I dare you to go on YouTube, call up and watch those low-light tapes of the cavalcade of Draymond Green’s dirtiest plays over the years … the cheap shots, the low blows, the dangerous plays. Draymond is the all-time cheap-shot artist.” Overall, it is safe to say that the beef between<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> Draymond Green and Skip Bayless</a> will keep going well into the next NBA season.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdoZn9yhJBmm6uZqaK8r7CMnKOaqKNir6KvymaYrWWjoLaxecGasKWdo6h6orPAoqVmppKWeq%2Bx1qw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
