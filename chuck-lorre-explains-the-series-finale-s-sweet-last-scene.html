I thought it was great and I said, ‘That’s our theme song.’ He said, ‘No, we’re a band, we do everything as a band. We have to re-record this as a Barenaked Ladies song with the whole band.”</p><p>Lorre wound up relenting — a point he now says, in hindsight, was the right decision — and the the song, dubbed “History of Everything,” became synonymous with Big Bang Theory for&nbsp;diehards.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>“I always loved that acoustic version,” Lorre says of the song that started out as a demo. “I called Ed a month or so ago and asked him if he would consider re-recording an acoustic version, slowing it down, singing it out of time so that it’s somewhat free of a time signature and use it for the last scene just over the characters having dinner. We went in the studio and recorded it and it was perfect.”</p><p>The band would wind up performing the eventual theme song live at the show’s San Diego Comic-Con panel back in 2010 that featured a packed ballroom of thousands singing along in unison. (Watch that performance, below.)</p><p></p><p>“One of the gifts of being part of this series all these years was Ed Robertson, and the Barenaked Ladies have just given us an enormous boost,” Lorre says. “That theme song gives you such a good feeling at the beginning of every episode. It’s a remarkable little piece of music. I defy anybody to listen to that song and not smile.”</p><p>Lorre added that using the concept for the original song was an important part of the series finale, which wound up focusing on the characters’ “emotional closure” rather than sending everyone off in different directions and wrapping the show up with a big bow.</p><p>“I just thought maybe it would be appropriate to go back to that acoustic version, slow it down, imbue it with a melancholy mood and take us out and that be our last piece of the finale,” Lorre said.</p><p>Watch the scene, below. <a href=#>Click here</a> to read THR‘s interviews with the producers and <a href=#>here</a> for the cast’s thoughts on how their respective journeys ended.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOm6CgZZKWu6h506GcqKqpYrCpwcKkZKWnoqeybrHXqaOaoZ6oerSx0aKcrGWWnruiuMSsZKyvlZrBbrjArKtmq5Oau6Z5kGtoam1nZ3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
