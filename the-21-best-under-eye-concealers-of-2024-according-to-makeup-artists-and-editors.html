We narrowed down the competition to the absolute best under-eye concealer formulas you're guaranteed to fall in love with and toss in your purse, no matter what the occasion. From luxury retailers to classic <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/makeup/g4866/best-drugstore-concealers/>drugstore concealers,</a> we made sure to select the concealers armed to perfect all of your under-eye needs this season.

Take a look at the ingredient list. Balsamo says ingredients with hydrating and emulsifying properties are a must-have in an under-eye concealer. “Emulsifying ingredients help smooth the skin and fill fine texture and lines,” she explains. “A good one to look out for is dimethicone.”&nbsp;</p><p>Madorma seconds this, adding that <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a34614628/hyaluronic-acid-for-skin-benefits-uses/>hyaluronic acid</a> and castor seed oil are the two ingredients she always looks for in an under-eye concealer. In case you were wondering, “the castor seed oil with help smooth out texture and keep the under-eye hydrated throughout the wear time,” Madorma explains. Meanwhile, “the hyaluronic acid will help with any imperfections under the eye, and together they will work great!”</p><p>Both Balsamo and Madorma agree that to find the perfect under-eye concealer for you, you have to match a concealer’s texture with your skin type and needs. For example, Balsamo explains for mature skin, a thin, hydrating formula will prevent creasing, while those with oily skin would benefit from a matte formula which “also helps prevent mascara from transferring from bottom lashes to the skin by eliminating excess oil or moisture.” &nbsp;</p><p>For specific skin concerns such as dark circles, blemishes, scarring, or pigmentation, Madorma recommends a pot concealer (such as RMS Beauty’s “Un” Cover-Up Concealer, below). She says, “They are extremely pigmented, creamy, and work well on top of makeup as well as underneath to cover any blemish.” But if you’re just looking for light under-eye coverage or added brightness, Madorma says to go with a liquid or pen formula since these are “so hydrating and easy to blend.” All in all, consider your skin needs first before weighing your under-eye concealer options. To make shopping for your skin type easier, we’ve provided pros and cons for each of the vetted products below.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-best-under-eye-concealers><span>The Best Under-Eye Concealers</span></h2><a href=# data-model-name="Double Duty Shape Tape Contour Concealer" data-url=https://www.ulta.com/p/shape-tape-concealer-xlsImpprod14251035 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fshape-tape-concealer-xlsImpprod14251035&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=ulta.com data-merchant-id=204095 data-merchant-url=ulta.com data-merchant-network=Generic readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bQBGWyo7Ld64tmLKsoYuuS-1920-80.png><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Overall Under-Eye Concealer</span></p></a><p>Tarte Double Duty Shape Tape Contour Concealer</p><p>In case 8,000 five-star reviews don't speak for themselves, maybe you'll be wooed by the fact that this cult-favorite concealer is filled with Amazonian clay (to soak up skin oils to prevent midday slippage), plus hydrating shea butter, olive oil, and sunflower seed oil to keep skin dewy and hydrated all day long.

Create an instant lift with NYX's affordable option. As Madorma suggests below, opt for a shade or two lighter than your natural skin tone for a brightening effect in seconds.

"I use this concealer on top of regular concealer to provide a brightening effect without adding too much coverage," says Parsons.

Make sure you blend that out and let dry before going in with your under-eye concealer.</li><li>Then go in with your under-eye concealer in either your true skin tone, or one to two shades lighter for added brightness. “Work with little amounts when applying and add coverage as needed,” Madorma recommends. “This will make any makeup application look natural and flawless!” &nbsp;</li><li>Finally, finish off with just a touch of powder to set (if you prefer), then you’re on your way to flawless under eyes. &nbsp;</li><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-meet-the-experts><span>Meet the Experts</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bQBGWyo7Ld64tmLKsoYuuS-1920-80.png><span class=person__name>Erin Parsons</span><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=INSTAGRAM><span class=button-social__icon></span></a><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=WEBSITE><span class="button-social__icon button-social__icon-website"></span></a>Celebrity Makeup Artist and Farfetch Global Artist<p>Erin Parsons love of vintage beauty is splashed across her videos on <a href=#>TikTok</a>, on which she boasts over 1.7 million followers.
