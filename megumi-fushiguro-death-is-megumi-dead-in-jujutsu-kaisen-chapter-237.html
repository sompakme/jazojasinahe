Following the shocking events of chapter 236, where fans grappled with the loss of Satoru Gojo, chapter 237 promises another roller-coaster of emotions. With the stakes higher than ever, the anticipation surrounding the fate of Megumi Fushiguro and the imminent clash between Sukuna and Hajime Kashimo is palpable.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Sukuna’s Resurgence and Megumi’s Quandary</strong></h2><p>A standout element of the upcoming chapter revolves around the revival of Sukuna in his original Heian Era form, a monumental event that could shift the balance of power. But what has caused great concern among fans is Megumi Fushiguro’s role in this transformation. Sukuna’s decision to employ Megumi as his vessel poses significant questions about the young jujutsu sorcerer’s fate. Given that Megumi lacks the proficiency to control a being as formidable as Sukuna, many wonder if he will emerge unscathed from this ordeal.</p><p>Furthermore, Sukuna’s decision to eliminate Tsumiki Fushiguro using Megumi’s own technique adds another layer of tragedy to the narrative. This move not only demoralizes Megumi but also raises doubts about his future in the storyline.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Kashimo’s Brave Confrontation</strong></h2><p>As the plot unfolds, Hajime Kashimo steps into the spotlight, challenging the formidable Sukuna. The ensuing battle, marked by Kashimo’s deployment of the “Genju Kohasaku” Cursed Technique, promises to be a spectacle. By pushing his body to its utmost limits, Kashimo is set to give Sukuna a run for his money. Yet, with the technique’s self-destructive nature, fans are on edge, waiting to see if Kashimo will emerge victorious or succumb to his own power.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Mystery of the Missing</strong></h2><p>Amidst the chaos, observant fans have noted the conspicuous absence of key characters like Yuji, Yuta, Shoko, and even the fallen Gojo. This has led to speculations. Could they be part of an elaborate plan to resurrect or possibly heal Gojo? Their disappearance adds layers of intrigue, ensuring readers stay hooked to every development.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>A Glimpse into Future Chapters</strong></h2><p>As battles rage and fates hang in the balance, Jujutsu Kaisen chapter 237 sets the stage for even more dramatic turns. Kashimo, despite his seemingly straightforward technique, might have surprises in store for Sukuna. After all, in a world as unpredictable as Jujutsu Kaisen, nothing is ever as it seems.</p><p>Jujutsu Kaisen continues to captivate readers with its intricate plot and deep character development. Chapter 237 is a testament to this, seamlessly weaving intense battles with poignant character moments. As fans await the outcome of Kashimo’s face-off with Sukuna and seek clarity on Megumi’s fate, one thing is certain: Jujutsu Kaisen remains a masterclass in storytelling. With each chapter, it solidifies its position as a must-read in the world of manga.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbjAp5ylpJmdsrOty51lnKedZIF6fpRopJ6fpaK2brLUrJ%2Bin6WnvG6wxJqroWWZqHquscaupKJllJqupXnIp2SjrZqqwbTBjKSYoquVo3qktMCpq56qXWeAeHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
