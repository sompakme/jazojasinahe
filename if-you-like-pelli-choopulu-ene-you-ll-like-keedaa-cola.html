Meanwhile, the team celebrated a grand pre-release event with Vijay Deverakonda attending it as a chief guest.</p><p>Brahmanandam said, “I personally got a feeling that Tharun Bhascker gave logical reasons to make the people laugh. It’s not an easy thing. Many asked why I acted in the movie. The only reason is Tharun Bhascker. This team treated me like the elder person in their family. I bow my head for all their caring. The comedy was created with a novel thought.”</p><p>Tharun Bhascker said, “I used to fear while I was doing Pelli Choopulu and Ee Nagaraniki Emaindhi. I didn’t like my own dialogues. Nobody likes their own movies. I watched Keedaa Cola, and I’m very confident. There are many factors for a film to become successful. Crime comedy is my favourite genre. I’ve to thank my friends and producers who have been my support system. This movie made me rediscover what I have in life. We have made this movie only to make you laugh. We tried to write it differently and bring humour in different ways. Forget all your problems in November.”</p><p>Vijay Deverakonda said, “Tharun Bhascker introduced me with Pelli Choopulu. Three things change our lives- the atmosphere we grow up, the decisions we make, and the people we meet. Nag Ashwin, Sandeep Reddy and Tharun Bhascker were not my childhood friends. We had similar dreams. We didn’t have any background. I’m fortunate to meet these people. These are my support system. After delivering such big hits, Tharun will have access to make movies with a better star and a big budget. But that’s not his style. He is giving life to many upcoming actors.</p><p>I watched the trailer of Keedaa Cola and everybody performed so well. Another bunch of actors get to live their dream. I admire and respect Tharun for that. He has been a blessing to the industry. Other than just direction, he acts, does interviews, and promotes others’ movies. If you like Pelli Choopulu, ENE, you will love this one as well.</p><p>Me and Tharun Bhascker are coming together once again very soon, as he already narrated a story. I’m super hit. You’ll see Vijay Deverakonda and Tharun Bhascker together again very very soon.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qMHLrZxnm5%2BifK671aKcp52nqHxzgpRrbXFnmZt6urvUZqOio5Vivaa4y6JknKCfpL22uNRmnKedXa68trjLZqOio5ViuKaxw5qYZpufoa4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
