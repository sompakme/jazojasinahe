The challenge of being someone else, standing in another person’s shoes, so to speak. Sometimes, though, those shoes can be constricting, especially if the actor finds themselves pigeonholed as a specific type of character.</span></p><p><span>There are certain actors who seem better off as the good guy, the nice guy, the pleasant guy. So when they go against type, it can be somewhat shocking. But it is a challenge they are more than willing to undertake. Here are 10 times a nice guy actor crossed over to bad guy territory and became the villain.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/johnny-depp-black-mass.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2 class=slide-title>Johnny Depp as Whitey Bulger in Black Mass (2015)</h2><p><span>There is no doubt that</span><a href=#> <span>Johnny Depp</span></a><span> has played a number of morally questionable characters in his film career. But he has never taken a turn toward the dark side like he did playing true-life gangster</span><a href=#> <span>Whitey Bulger</span></a><span> in </span><i><span>Black Mass</span></i><span>. Depp played Bulger with psychopathic glee, enveloping himself in the character much like he did as Captain Jack Sparrow. It is a true testament to Depp’s range, but one that leaves you wanting more Captain Jack.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chris-evans-gray-man.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2 class=slide-title>Chris Evans as Lloyd Hansen in The Gray Man (2022)</h2><p><span>After seeing Chris Evans as Steve Rogers in all of those Marvel movies, watching him take a turn as a complete sociopath in </span><i><span>The Gray Man</span></i><span> was actually a fun watch. Maybe it was his delivery, a smarmy psycho who turned his charm and charisma into a “nice guy” and made himself especially, yet lovingly, loathed as he tried to hunt down Ryan Gosling’s Six.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hugh-jackman-les-miserables.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2 class=slide-title>Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean in Les Misérables (2012)</h2><p><span>There are, perhaps, levels of villainy where certain actors feel they can go. In</span><a href=#> <i><span>Les Misérables</span></i></a><span>, Hugh Jackman plays Jean Valijean, a man who has been in prison for 19 years after stealing bread to help feed his sister’s children. Then, after sitting in prison for a while, Jean attempts an escape, which only added to his prison time. When Valijean is finally released from prison, he immediately returns to his life of crime. But only after getting caught for stealing silverware to get money, he is forgiven by the bishop he stole from, prompting him to begin life anew as an honest man.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jim-carrey-count-olaf.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2 class=slide-title>Jim Carrey as Count Olaf in Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004)</h2><p><span>Throughout his film career,</span><a href=#> <span>Jim Carrey</span></a><span> has worn many different faces. For the most part, they have all been hilariously rich and fun. This did not change when he took on the role of Count Olaf in </span><i><span>Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events</span></i><span>, but what we did see from Carrey in this film is his turn to the bad side. Carrey’s Olaf was immediately seen as a conniving, selfish, greedy man. He simply wants to get rid of the three children who have inherited a family fortune after their parents perished in a mysterious house fire.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/robert-pattinson-good-time.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2 class=slide-title>Robert Pattinson as Connie Nikas in Good Time (2017)</h2><p><span>By the time</span><a href=#> <span>Robert Pattinson</span></a><span> played it bad as Connie Nikas in Good Time, he was already well-established as Edward Cullen in the </span><i><span>Twilight</span></i><span> saga. Although a vampire in those films, the character was never considered to be “bad” or a villain. In </span><i><span>Good Time</span></i><span>, that would change for Pattinson. Here he plays a small-time criminal who, after attempting to steal $65,000 from a bank with his developmentally disabled brother, tries to free his brother from police custody after being caught for the robbery. It’s a turn to the villain role that Pattison does quite well.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/steve-carell-foxcatcher.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2 class=slide-title>Steve Carell as John E. du Pont in Foxcatcher (2014)</h2><p><span>This one definitely came out of left field. Steve Carell, who is best known as Michael Scott in the hit TV series, </span><i><span>The Office</span></i><span>, takes a turn as the villain in </span><i><span>Foxcatcher. </span></i><span>It’s </span><span>a film based on the true-life events surrounding the 1996 murder of Olympic wrestling gold medalist Dave Schultz. Carell was praised for his performance as the mentally ill millionaire and wrestling enthusiast,</span><a href=#> <span>John E. du Pont.</span></a><span> But it was a role most Carell fans were not ready for.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/tom-cruise-collateral.jpg alt="tom cruise netflix" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2 class=slide-title>Tom Cruise as Vincent in Collateral (2004)</h2><p><span>In this Michael Mann-directed film, Tom Cruise is pitch-perfect as Vincent, a villainous hitman who chooses cab driver Max (</span><a href=#><span>Jamie Foxx</span></a><span>) as his wheels as he goes on a Los Angeles contract killing spree. The film puts Cruise out of his comfort zone as a bad guy, but it is a role that appears to fit him quite well.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/robin-williams-one-hour-photo.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2 class=slide-title>Robin Williams as Sy Parrish in One Hour Photo (2002)</h2><p><a href=#><span>Robin Williams</span></a><span> surprised the hell out of fans when he took on the role of Sy Parish in One Hour Photo. In the film, Parish is a photo technician who suddenly finds himself obsessed with the Yorkin family he has provided services for many years. The more Sy sees the pictures, the more obsessed he becomes, to the point where violence is his only answer. Williams shows an amazing ability to move away from comedy and test out these new waters. It’s a bravura performance.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tom-hanks-road-to-perdition-netflix.jpg alt="tom hanks" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2 class=slide-title>Tom Hanks as John Rooney in Road to Perdition (2002)</h2><p><span>Consummate nice guy Tom Hanks decided to switch things up a bit with his performance as villain John Rooney in </span><i><span>Road to Perdition</span></i><span>. It was a big departure for Hanks as he had always been seen in fun films such as </span><i><span>Splash, The Money Pit, Big</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>A League of Their Own</span></i><span>. In this film, Hanks stars opposite Paul Newman and is a mob enforcer in the Great Depression era. Hanks goes big and bad in this film, seeking revenge on the mobsters who killed his wife and younger son.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/heath-ledger-joker.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2 class=slide-title>Heath Ledger as The Joker in The Dark Knight (2008)</h2><p><span>Talk about taking a turn from good to villain, Heath Ledger went above and beyond in Christopher Nolan’s </span><i><span>The Dark Knight</span></i><span>. Ledger won an Oscar (posthumously) as The Joker, a role that was most criticized when it was first announced. But once Ledger put on that Joker makeup, he changed minds and won over fans worldwide.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2immZiybrPUsmSam6Skv7R51aKjpZmZo8BvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
