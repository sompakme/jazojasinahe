Knowing this will allow him to control the narrative for once, Eli adopts a new hairstyle in the form of a mohawk.<h2>Why did they cut hawks hair in Cobra Kai?</h2>He was a real jerk at Cobra Kai, and even after he left for Eagle Fang, he was still a bully to Kenny. In Episode 5 of Season 4, “Match Point,” Cobra Kai decided to get some payback. Since they couldn't fight before the tournament, they cornered Hawk at a tattoo parlor, pinned him and cut off his mohawk.<h2>What happened to Eli's mohawk?</h2>Or perhaps I should rephrase; Eli lost his mohawk. After getting soaked by surprise sprinklers on the baseball diamond in Cobra Kai Season 4 Episode 4, Robby (Tanner Buchanan), Tory (Peyton List) and some of the other Cobra Kai students decide to stoop to an especially low form of payback.<h2>Does Hawk lose his mohawk in Cobra Kai?</h2>The way Eli “Hawk” Moskowitz started Cobra Kai season 4 was not how he ended it. The iconic mohawk that has become synonymous with the character was shaved off in episode 5 as the rivalry between Miyagi-do and Cobra Kai raged on. Despite this jaw-dropping moment, Hawk emerged like a phoenix by the end of the season.<h2>Hawks Hair Gets Cut Off By Cobra Kai</h2><p></p><h2>Why didnt Hawk join Eagle Fang?</h2>The two were not mutually exclusive. Cobra Kai and by extension Eagle Fang created Hawk, but rejected Eli. In order for Eli/Hawk to accept his identity, he needed to be in an environment that would welcome Eli and Hawk. Miyagi-Do was the place where he could just be himself.<h2>Is that Hawks real hair?</h2>Well, for starters, there are no wigs, weaves, or other appliances involved in the creation of Hawk's signature 'do; that's his real hair. "It takes about an hour to put up and it's almost all hair spray, which is pretty nuts," Bertrand revealed in a recent interview with TVLine.<h2>Is Hawk a good guy in Cobra Kai?</h2>Type of Villain<p>Eli Moskowitz, better known by his nickname Hawk, is one of the main characters of the Netflix series Cobra Kai, serving as a major character in Season 1, a secondary antagonist of Season 2, a major antagonist-turned-anti-heroic protagonist in Season 3 and one of the main protagonists of Season 4.</p><h2>What did Robbie do to Eli?</h2>In a moment of very telegenic anger, Robby opts not to re-tie his gi, and instead rips it off completely.

Yes Keene is Shannon's last name and she kept it for that reason due to Johnny not being there for him. Hello, It seems like you are new here, if so welcome to The Karate Kid wiki.<h2>Who is Miguel's dad in Cobra Kai?</h2>Therefore, we only know Miguel's father as Mr. Diaz, who lives in Mexico. He also didn't even know about Miguel's existence because Miguel's mother never told him about his son. The upcoming Cobra Kai season might finally reveal who Miguel's daddy is.<h2>Who wears a wig in Cobra Kai?</h2>While the karate-filled action of Cobra Kai may be the film's centerpiece, many fans have shown interest in Ralph Macchio's appearance, primarily his hair and whether or not the 58-year-old actor wears a wig.<h2>Is Kreese Johnny's dad?</h2>The Karate Kid films didn't address Johnny's biological father too much, but viewers later found out his stepfather was incredibly abusive to him. If his home life wasn't rough enough, Johnny also faced abuse from his sensei John Kreese -- the true villain of The Karate Kid.<h2>Who won Eli or Robby?</h2>In the end, Eli hits Robby on the chest and gets the final point.

When they try to hurt Demetri, Hawk instantly switches sides to protect his friend instead of causing him even more harm.<h2>Does Tory go to Miyagi-Do?</h2>Tory Nichols joining the Miyagi-Do in Cobra Kai season 5 is a better story direction than Robby Keene returning to his former dojo.
