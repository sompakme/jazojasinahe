Smith made his NBA debut with the Boston Celtics in 1989, <a href=#>per the Chicago Tribune</a>, playing two seasons before his career came to an abrupt halt.</p><p>On March 22, 1991, Smith went to a club with his college roommate,&nbsp;AP reported, where the Chicago Tribune reported he'd drank a couple of beers over two hours.
