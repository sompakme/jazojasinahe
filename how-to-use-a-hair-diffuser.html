It snaps on easily at the end of the dryer, so you won't have to worry about it falling off while getting to work. Some hair diffusers even have universal sizes that can fit multiple dryers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But to get into all the reasons why a hair diffuser is a must for your curls and how to use the attachment properly, we reached out to a few curly hair experts to break it all down for you.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-use-a-hair-diffuser></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How To Use a Hair Diffuser&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">How you use a diffuser will depend on your hair length and thickness. But in general, celebrity hairstylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Nai’vasha</a> recommends using the tool on towel-dried hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When you're ready to go, she suggests gathering curls carefully and placing them on the mouth opening of the diffuser. Making sure that you’re working with medium to low heat (this is the heat setting she prefers because it replicates air drying), you’ll hold the diffuser close to the head for about five seconds (more if you have thicker curls). Then move the diffuser in a circular motion for another five seconds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Follow up with a pumping motion for five seconds, and then go back and hold the diffuser close to the scalp for another five seconds before releasing your curls. Repeat this for all sections until your hair is dry.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fellow celebrity hairstylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Irinel de León</a> adds that if you like your curls to look elongated, you’ll want to avoid cupping the hair into the diffuser for too long. But if you do want bouncier shorter curls, she says to cup hair into the diffuser for about 30 seconds. And for that extra body and volume, she suggests flipping hair upside and moving the diffuser in an up-and-down motion, cupping your curls for 30 seconds at a time.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It’s also important to remember that moisture is key when using a hair diffuser. She recommends using products that give hair hold and moisture. She likes starting with a leave-in-conditioner, followed by a hydrating cream, and the finishing off with a gel.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-benefits-of-using-a-hair-diffuser></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Benefits of Using a Hair Diffuser</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nai'vasha explains that a diffuser is designed to evenly distribute hot air from your blowdryer to reduce frizz. De Leon agrees and adds that a diffuser can help stimulate natural drying, improve overall definition of curls, and emphasize the natural curl pattern. Also, because it uses less heat, it helps protect hair from heat damage. So it really does it all for those natural curls.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">”A diffuser is a curly hair bestie,” says Nai'vasha. “It evades frizz, speeds up drying time, and encourages chunky pieces. A regular drying experience tends to dehydrate the hair and straighten [those curls].”&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-look-for-when-getting-a-hair-diffuser></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to look for when getting a hair diffuser</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hair diffusers come in different sizes, and with so much on the market these days, you’ll be able to find something that works best for your hair. But if you need some guidance, Nai’vasha recommends looking for a diffuser that’s on the bigger side with lots of prongs; she explains that this will speed up the drying time and allow for airflow to move farther throughout your hair.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She personally likes diffusers like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>T3 SoftTouch 3 Diffuser</a>, which she says has lots of prongs and air outlets to create a faster drying process. She's also a fan of the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>YS Park Ion Diffuser</a>, which she calls her favorite because it folds, is easy to pack, and uses ion technology to act similarly to traditional diffusers with prons, while protecting the integrity of your curls. De León’s pick is the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Dyson Diffuser</a>, which has long prongs to reach deep into the hair and allow you to style curls with greater control.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>All Natural</a>.&nbsp;From the kinkiest coils to loose waves, we're celebrating natural hair in its many forms by sharing expert tips for styling, maintenance, and haircare.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x5qgq2WUnrOnwdKeqWZuaG59d36S</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
