DeCagny (who also trains Cosmo) describes Clyde’s breakthrough role to be a close representation of his hyper off-screen personality. “His mind is all over the place,” she says. “He always needs to be put back into working mode.”</p><p><strong>Popcorn Deelites from 2003’s Seabiscuit</strong></p><p>The star has shifted gears from the racetrack to the paddock at Old Friends, a retirement home for thoroughbred racehorses. Old Friends founder <strong>Michael Blowen</strong> confesses that though Popcorn is a favorite among visitors, his stunts in the film were CGI’d: “Popcorn Deelites wasn’t a great racehorse, but he’s an actor.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>PHOTOS: Doggie Treats: 7 Ways to Pamper Your Pooch</strong></a></p><p><strong>Ted Nudegent as Mr. Bigglesworth from 1997’s Austin Powers</strong></p><p>Though Dr. Evil’s sidekick passed away a few years ago, his nephews, Hairless Potter and Skindiana Jones, are continuing the second generation of Sphynx cat actors and have been featured in FX’s American Horror Story and 2007’s I Know Who Killed Me. Trainer <strong>Tammy Maples</strong> expressed that contrary to their horrifying roles, Sphynx cats are an affectionate breed. “As long as they’re interacting with people, they’re happy,” she says.</p><p><strong>Moonie as Bruiser from 2001’s Legally Blonde</strong></p><p>With the exception of a few commercial features, the stylish Legally Blonde star has retreated from the big screen. “He’s kind of retired at this point, since he’s about 14 to 15 years old,” says trainer <strong>Sue Chipperton</strong>. Often seen decked out in sweaters and headgear in the comedy film, Moonie had to be trained to keep his hat on while cameras were rolling. Says Chipperton: Along with being fed treats, “it was part of his reward to have it taken off.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKm7y6WwsKefmcBursignp6rpGKur7XMmqNmq6SWv7R5wKucZm1pbX52fI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
