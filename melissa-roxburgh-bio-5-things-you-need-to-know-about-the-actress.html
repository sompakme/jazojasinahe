Movie Credits</span></strong></h4><p><span>Fresh out of high school, Melissa Roxburgh knew what career she wanted to pursue so she hired an agent and it wasn’t long before she landed her first role.&nbsp;Her first notable film credit was in Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules, where she was cast as Rachel in 2011, and she followed the following year with a different role in the sequel Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Dog Days – this time she was cast as Heather Hills.</span></p><p>She has also had significant roles in several other films including&nbsp;<span>Big Time Movie</span><span>&nbsp;as Princess (2012),&nbsp;</span><span>Leprechaun: Origins</span><span>&nbsp;as Jeni (2014),&nbsp;</span><span>The Marine 4: Moving Target</span><span>&nbsp;as Loivia Tanis (2015),&nbsp;</span><span>Star Trek Beyond</span><span>&nbsp;as Ensign Syl (2016), as well as&nbsp;</span><span>Loss of Comfort</span><span>&nbsp;as Azaria, also in 2016.</span></p><h4><strong><span>2.
