She was married to "Seinfeld" actor John O'Hurley for two years and then tied the knot with her "All My Children" co-star, John Callahan, who sadly <a href=#>died at age 66</a> in March 2020 (they divorced in 2005). Her third marriage was to Joe Cappuccio, but it was Callahan to whom she remained the closest, because he was the father of her only child, Kaya.</p><p>LaRue has publicly talked openly about her late ex-husband's legacy and the big "hole" he left in their family after he died of a stroke. "We are extremely sadden [sic] and distraught over the loss of John," LaRue said in a statement to <a href=#>People</a>. "He was my great friend, co-parent and amazing father to Kaya. The absence of his bigger than life, gregarious personality will leave a hole in our hearts forever."</p><p>She got even more personal on her Instagram page with <a href=#>an emotional post</a>&nbsp;about the man she referred to as her "'All My Children' soap stud," sharing that she loved his "big belly laugh, bear hugs, bad puns, ability to harmonize to any song, great kitchen table singing-fests, and two steppin bad a**!" And if you want to sob just a little bit more, LaRue and Kaya made sure to adopt Callahan's dog, Cali, after his death. "She was John's baby," LaRue revealed on <a href=#>Instagram</a>. "And I know she'll be just what God ordered to help us heal and vice versa."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW1mbH5xe9OhnGaqlZa5brjIn5xmqJGnwa%2Bx0axkqJ5dqbWmecKaqq1ln5t6pL%2FIZqSimZ2efA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
