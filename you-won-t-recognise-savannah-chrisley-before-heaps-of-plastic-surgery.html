However, there’s a side to her that viewers haven’t seen on the show – her journey through plastic surgery. While following in her father Todd’s footsteps, she made the decision to undergo a nose job, altering her appearance. Let’s delve into Savannah’s transformation by examining older pictures of her before she ventured into the world of plastic surgery.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Savannah’s Nose Job</strong></h3><p>Savannah openly admitted to having a nose job, a decision that significantly changed the shape of her nose. Although she has never confirmed undergoing procedures like Botox or fillers, there has been widespread speculation about how her face has transformed over the past eight years. Unlike her father Todd, who has been transparent about his plastic surgery journey, Savannah chose a different approach. She underwent surgery in the summer of 2020 to remove a cyst and has also had three surgeries to manage endometriosis, a condition she was diagnosed with in 201Additionally, she plans to freeze her eggs, highlighting her commitment to her health.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>The Transformation: Before and After</strong></h3><p>At 24 years old, Savannah’s earlier pictures reveal a different version of her, likely around 17 years old, navigating the challenges of puberty. One noticeable change is her nose, which used to dip at the end but has since been lifted. While unconfirmed, it appears that she may have had fillers in her cheeks and lips, as they appear more pronounced now. Moreover, her makeup routine has evolved over the years, contributing to her transformed appearance. Some fans might even say that Savannah is unrecognizable now. Fortunately, she boasts an impressive jawline, eliminating the need for filler in that area.</p><h3><strong>Savannah Addresses Implants Rumors</strong></h3><p>During an Instagram Live session, Savannah was asked about breast implants. She emphatically denied having breast implants and humorously stated that her curves were a result of “God and too much food.” She confirmed her nose job but wanted to set the record straight about her natural curves. Savannah is a strong advocate for embracing one’s individuality and making personal choices, regardless of others’ opinions. In an Instagram post from October 2019, she encouraged women to be true to themselves and not base their choices on others’ preferences.Savannah’s transformation reflects her journey of self-discovery and self-expression. Her decision to undergo a nose job and address health concerns openly showcases her commitment to living life on her terms. As she continues to evolve, both personally and professionally, Savannah’s openness about her experiences serves as an inspiration for others to embrace their own paths of self-improvement and authenticity.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiaHxyfI6ypq5lp6S7tXnRnpqon56ewKZ50pqtmqaelrVur8eroKykla56o7HFqKmeZZiarrG%2FjKidZqiclsC1tcJmqq6ql5q%2FunrHraSl</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
