Moreover, they ran into each other at a BET Awards afterparty and confronted each other, with security and entourages trying to stop their face-to-face as Ray swung on Plummer. Eventually, the singer and actor conceded and went back into his car at the behest of his team after trying to pull something out of his backpack. He had previously accused the CEO of being a "Black Jeffrey Epstein" and claimed that he has abusive, exploitative, and manipulative tendencies towards women.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While it's unclear what prompted this fight -– and Lemuel Plummer hasn't said anything about it at press time -– Ray J took to his Instagram Story to air out <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">his grievances</a>. Content warning: this could be triggering material for some readers, as these remarks include references to self-harm. Text 988 if you need a crisis counselor for emotional support.

Ray J continued. "To provide for my family and have generational wealth was always the plan. But <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">money is evil and people are bad</a> and I can’t take it anymore. These chain of reactions are stemming from being locked in a false reality / confused by this whole life! The s**t that happened tonight to me at the awards today was hurtful. I'm working backstage and then I go take a break in the back and BET wouldn't let me back in for some reason. I don't know who they didn't want me to see. It was weird. Anyway I left and went back to silence my frustrations. Flashing back to my everyday thought of my life, the truth that's given is a LIE!</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ray-speaks-out>Ray Speaks Out</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Im on my way out of the country," Ray J concluded. "The s**t that is happening is mind blowing. It’s making me suicidal and uncomfortable with the perception of reality. THEY PAID ME TO SHUT UP AND I DID! I FEEL BAD AND I HATE MYSELF FOR IT! I DONT WANT ANYMORE OF YOUR DIRTY MONEY! And B4! Or Right after I die I promise you I will be free of it all and the world can move on with what is real for me no matter the consequences I have to face on the other side!! I TRIED TO DO IT FOR REAL LAST TIME! <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I'm sorry to myself and [my] sister sorry Bran</a>, I will make it right, I won't let them get away with it!

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output.

As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdoZ350hJNmqZqxXZ96rbHMrpylZaChwq65xKtkn6GXncFuxsSuqmamlanEsL7KZpynrJWnwaK1zaacp6xdo7K4vw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
