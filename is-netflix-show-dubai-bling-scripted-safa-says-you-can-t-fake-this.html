However, its opulence has led some to question its authenticity. Is it scripted or real? Safa Siddiqui and Zeina Khoury, two stars of the show, have addressed these rumors. Let’s dive into the world of Dubai Bling and discover what sets it apart.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Dubai Bling Unveiled</strong></h3><p>Dubai Bling, a reality docusoap, chronicles the daily extravagance of the wealthy in Dubai. It’s just one of Netflix’s many shows celebrating opulence, in the company of Selling Sunset and Bling Empire. The show’s cast is a diverse blend of personalities hailing from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Kuwait, and Iraq. Their lives are an exquisite mix of fashion shows, private jets, luxury cars, and designer wardrobes.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>The Script Speculation</strong></h3><p>Some viewers have pondered whether Dubai Bling follows a script. To get to the bottom of this, the co-stars Safa Siddiqui and Zeina Khoury shared their insights when questioned by Kris Fade on The Kris Fade Show on Virgin Radio DXB. Both Safa and Zeina debunked the scripted claims with unwavering certainty. Zeina humorously responded, “If it was scripted, I would have found a better line than, ‘I am the company.'” Safa chimed in, emphasizing, “You can’t fake this, baby, you can’t.” Kris Fade himself backed their assertions.</p><h3><strong>Real Lives, Real Stories</strong></h3><p>Dubai Bling is all about real people living real lives. Netflix classifies it as a “reality docusoap,” essentially a documentary that chronicles the lives of individuals in specific occupations or locations over an extended period.</p><p>While not all cast members are native to Dubai, their stories are genuine. DJ Bliss, known as Marwan Parham Al Awadhi, is the sole Dubai Bling star born and raised in the city, while others have found their way there. The relationships portrayed on the show are authentic – those who are married have genuinely exchanged vows. For example, Loujain Adada’s marriage to the late Walid Juffali is factual, supported by widespread coverage of their wedding.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>Although the cast is introduced as millionaires, Arabian Business reports that only four cast members boast a net worth exceeding $1 million – Ebraheem Al Samadi, Loujain Adada, Kris, and Brianna Fade.</p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>Dubai Bling, despite its dazzling displays of wealth, is the real deal. Safa and Zeina’s firm denials leave no room for doubt about the show’s authenticity. It’s a genuine glimpse into the extravagant lives of the wealthy, providing viewers with an unfiltered view of Dubai’s elite.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span> <span class="post-views-icon dashicons dashicons-chart-bar"></span> <span class=post-views-label>Post Views:</span> <span class=post-views-count>6</span><br>Spread the love<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiaHxyfI6iqmamlamzrbXXZqqhp6disbauwKJkm6SZo7Ruv8KroKmslZl6tK3FmmSsmamoerq71GaamqakYrOit8Rmq6Gho2O1tbnL</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
