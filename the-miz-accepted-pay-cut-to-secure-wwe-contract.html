That being said, The Miz had a very rocky start to his WWE career, and many believed he would get fired. However, he persevered and became one of the mainstays of the company.</p><p>While speaking on the&nbsp;<a href=#>Unbreakable podcast</a>, The Miz talked about joining WWE. The A-Lister revealed that he willingly took a pay cut in order to join the company as he bet on himself.</p><p>“I was making a lot of money, I was making six figures. When I got to developmental, I took a pay cut, because I said ‘I can take a pay cut in this because I believe that I can make more.’</p><p>So I invested in myself. I’ve always invested in myself … I paid for acting classes, improv classes, and learning the art of professional wrestling, UPW, and wrestling classes. And then I also was like ‘Oh, where do all the big world trainers go? Gold’s Gym.</p><p>I worked out there, got a nutritionist. So I invested all my money I would make into myself. I bought all these t-shirts ahead of time and got them at $3 a t-shirt and sold them for $15 a t-shirt.</p><p>“So I wouldn’t make money off them, but it wasn’t to make money, it was necessary to promote myself and get people talking about me … so WWE would see that.</p><p>“WWE would see that, they gave me a contract, I took a pay cut, went to McDonough, Georgia, went to Louisville, and then from Louisville, I got into WWE and started making the money I thought I could possibly make.”</p><p>The Miz also had a promo battle with Drew McIntyre on this week’s episode of Monday Night RAW and was eventually defeated by The Scottish Warrior during the show. We’ll have to see what’s next in store for The A-Lister.</p><p>What’s your view on what The Miz said? Are you glad he decided to bet on himself in the company?
