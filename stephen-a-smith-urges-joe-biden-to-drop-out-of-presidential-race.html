The type of person who has voted for Republicans and Democrats during his adulthood. Recently, however, Smith has been making it clear that he dislikes both Joe Biden and Donald Trump. As it stands, there are <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">numerous questions about Biden's health.</a> Meanwhile, Trump continues to be one of the most divisive figures in American political history.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Last night, Joe Biden and Donald Trump took part in a debate. As it turns out, this debate was not particularly productive. In fact, many felt like it was a complete clown show. Biden had numerous slip-ups, and it is clear that his cognition is in decline. Following the debate, Smith took to social media where he admonished the Democrats for forcing Biden to run. Clearly, he would like to see the President step down, immediately.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-stephen-a-smith-speaks>Stephen A Smith Speaks</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"So do y’all finally want to stop arguing with me about Biden now???" Smith wrote. "Have your fears now been confirmed? <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">@MichelleObama</a>. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">@VP</a>. Somebody. Please help! Biden’s team WANTED this? His staff, His loved ones…. How could you put him out there like that!How could you!" At this point, there is no indication that Biden will step down. However, if he does, it will certainly be a massive story that will make constituents question why he was running, in the first place.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of this take from Stephen A Smith, in the comments section down below.
