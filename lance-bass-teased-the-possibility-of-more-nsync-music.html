But, if Lance Bass has anything to do with it, fans can expect more to come so that the sad state of "Better Place" can just be a blip in the rear view.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Entertainment Weekly</a>, the singer explained that nothing seemed to work out with their reunion and that he hopes more *NSYNC music can eventually get released and promoted the right way (is this a hint at an upcoming tour?).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I wish I had some answers for you, but as everyone knows, the strike continues and it really threw a wrench in all of this," he said. "We finally released a song after 23 years and we can't even mention the song and we can't talk about the movie it's in. It was going to be such a special moment for all of us, and unfortunately that got sidetracked."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for MTV</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bass went on to say that he feels like fans deserve more from the group, though he understands why actors are striking. EW notes that he's a member of both the Screen Actors Guild and the Writers Guild.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We have to get it right this time, and unfortunately, *NSYNC had to go down in flames for that one," he shared. "But we had so much fun, I don't see this as our last thing. Because of this strike, I feel like we owe it to the fans again to rectify this and do something else. But until the strike ends, we can't really even figure out what is next, if there's anything next. Hopefully we'll have a plan in place once this lifts and we're able to get back to work."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from teasing the infinite possibilities that may or may not materialize from his group, Bass added that none of them expected the warm reception at the VMAs, saying that the moment was "beautiful" and "overwhelming."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Even just doing the VMAs, I did not expect that many people to really care, but it was great to see," he said. "Especially since we're not even able to mention the song, the fact that it is on the radio and people are streaming it like no other is very special and shows how much love that our fans have and [the love] we have for our fans. We can't thank them enough."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y5qlnJ1dl660v4ympqudXaPAurrCZqSuq5mYeqe70WadmqajYoV0hZhpcG0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
