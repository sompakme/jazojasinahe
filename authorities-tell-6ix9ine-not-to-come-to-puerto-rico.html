In a statement shared to El Vocero de Puerto Rico and then reposted by DJ Akademiks, authorities in Puerto Rico warned the controversial rapper to stay away. "The commissioner of the Police Department, Antonio López Figueroa, told the Univisión network that it should refrain from the participation of rapper Daniel Hernández, artistically known as 6ix9ine, scheduled for this Thursday, at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico as part of the Premios Juventud," the statement begins.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It was actually 6ix9ine's only Univision network that first warned police about the threats to his life. While the police are asking him not to come to Puerto Rico, they can't actually prevent him from doing so and are reportedly working on a security plan in case he does. These threats come as the "FEFE" rapper began new beef in the world of Latin music. Former collaborator Anuel AA turned into an adversary when the pair got into it with <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">a heated exchange on Instagram</a>.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-6ix9ine-warned-not-to-go-to-puerto-rico>6ix9ine Warned Not To Go To Puerto Rico</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Earlier this year 6ix9ine surprise released his new album Leyenda Viva. It was his first new project since 2020's TattleTales. The album saw him shifting his sound from his usual style of highly intense hip-hop to the world of reggaeton. Recently, clips of the rapper singing an unreleased song hit the internet. Fans were excited to hear that the track appeared to be<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> a return to the form of his earlier material</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Earlier this month, 6ix9ine gave her girlfriend an extremely elaborate birthday gift. Despite the short time they've been dating, he really pulled out all of the stops for her. Included in the gifts was an <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">80k Rolex watch and 200k in cash</a>.
