She was in director <strong>Michael </strong><strong>Cimino</strong>’s first film, Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974), starring <strong>Clint Eastwood</strong> and <strong>Jeff Bridges</strong>, and showed up in Sextette (1978), which was to be her — and <strong>Mae West</strong>’s — final feature.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fairchild was the live-in girlfriend of singer <strong>Danny Hutton</strong>, and, according to commentary included with the 1993 CD set Celebrate: The Three Dog Night Story, 1965–1975, suggested the name for the band after reading an article about indigenous Australians.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She learned that on cold nights, these Australians would sleep in a hole with a dingo (a wild dog) to keep warm. They would need two dogs if it were colder, and if were really cold, then that would be a “three dog night,” Fairchild explained.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKvBzZ5kn5mZp7CptcudZJ2dkZl6tryMrKSoo5VihHiBkW1naA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
