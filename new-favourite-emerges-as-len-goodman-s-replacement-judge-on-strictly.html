We have similar personalities! I would be more tolerant of the music and give more rhythmical license. I would, however, probably be even stricter on the fundamentals!"</p><p style=text-align:center id=eFX5z3Ui_IQB data-wc=10><strong>Anton du Beke is among those tipped to replace Len</strong></p><p id=eoEoEsFsnu6r data-wc=116>co-host <a class=hm-link href=#>Tess Daly</a> has revealed that the new judge should be announced by April.

Brendan Cole has previously revealed how much he'd love to be considered for the role, telling : "I would love his job. I don't think there are many people who don't want his job. It's a fantastic job because you never get kicked off. It's fantastic. The BBC will choose whoever is right for the show. I'm hoping that they'll be considering me while making that decision."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
