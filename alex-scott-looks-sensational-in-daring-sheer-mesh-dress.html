Alex stepped it up a gear with an uber-cool bob. Her hair was styled with products to create a wet look and it was straightened into a flick at the ends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2e1dcb05fd9d-gettyimages-1795400053.jpg><p id=eZ27745CqMf data-wc=30>The former Arsenal player also upped her makeup game.

Whilst Leah and Chloe rocked sheer lace black dresses with bead details and a chic updo, Mary went for a more classically feminine aesthetic with her frilled green floral dress.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/603f899b439e-alex-scott-gq-lionesses.jpg><p id=ef3xfZ3XzSI data-wc=51>The event was a truly star-studded spectacle. <a class=hm-link href=#>Mollie King</a>, 36, BBC One presenter and member of The Saturdays, stunned in an umber-coloured ensemble comprised of a corseted midi vinyl dress with a matching oversized blazer. We loved how she wore her bobbed hair in natural waves to offset the edgy outfit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9a9f1481331a-mollie-king-gq.jpg><p id=e7q7wIHgvE1 data-wc=30><a class=hm-link href=#>Nicole Scherzinger</a>, 45, also brought her A game in an incredible waist-cinching corset blazer and matching wide-leg trousers.

The pundit took our breaths away when she <a class=hm-link href=#>debuted a beautiful hair transformation</a> in the form of long beachy waves for a piece in Attitude&nbsp;magazine. She added a 70s-style sweeping fringe and a woollen coat in a caramel shade.</p><p id=eDvV6GU5HNV data-wc=68>We were also obsessed with <a class=hm-link href=#>Alex's snow queen look</a> when she made a return to <a class=hm-link href=#>The One Show</a>'s sofa in October. She was spotted on the BBC show's Instagram alongside fellow presenter Alex Jones wearing a cream knit dress with matching knee-high cream boots in a crocodile effect leather. <a class=hm-link href=#>Alex Jones</a> matched Alex's glam energy in a pair of eye-catching silver skinny trousers and a trendy oversized jumper.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dd3c0cf625b3-alex-jones-and-alex-scott.png><p id=ezC-ILMMO6 data-wc=64>A leather look is a clear favourite with the best-selling memoir writer. She stunned in a <a class=hm-link href=#>black leather co-ord</a> made up of a pair of wide-leg trousers and a cropped jacket, again forgoing a top. We also loved the sheer look <a class=hm-link href=#>she rocked to the Virgin Atlantic Attitude Awards</a> when she arrived wearing a floor-length see-through lace gown with a dramatic feathered mermaid skirt.</p><p id=efxHL2p9R0c data-wc=16><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;</strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Alex Scott looks incredible in oversized blazer and heels after taking part in daring stunt</a></p><p id=evrUDyCrcM data-wc=37>And who could forget that incredible <a class=hm-link href=#>slinky chocolate brown dress</a> Alex wore to the UK premiere of <a class=hm-link href=#>the Beckhams' Netflix docuseries</a>?
