While James became embroiled in a feud with Trish Stratus, Punk went through ECW before finally arriving on RAW and SmackDown Live. However, James and Punk were initially set to debut together.<br>Twitter user <a href=#>@MikeinPA1</a> tweeted a flashback Friday photo that shows Punk and James at a dark match prior to an episode of RAW in 2005. The two Superstars look relatively different then the counterparts we know today.<br><br>This led to James responding on Twitter through her own account. James- who is currently employed by WWE on the RAW roster wonders how different her career would have been if she and Punk remained a pair as was planned by WWE during that dark match debut.<br><br>As we know, that never panned out. Punk had a successful run with WWE, but left the company years ago and filed a lawsuit against WWE’s doctor- which he famously won earlier this year. James was a multi-time Champion in WWE before leaving for Impact Wrestling. Now back, she is a core member of the women’s division.<br><strong>How different would Punk and James’ lives have been if WWE stuck to that plan? Does the pairing interest you for an on-screen role?
