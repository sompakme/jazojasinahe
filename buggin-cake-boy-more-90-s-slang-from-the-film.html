From Baldwins to Bettys, the complete <i>Clueless</i> dictionary:</p><p><b><i>Audi</i></b>: Leaving, exiting, out of here. (Not to be confused with the German automobile company.)</p><p>Context:</p><p>Dionne: “I do not wear polyester hair, OK? Unlike some people I know like Shawana.”</p><p>Cher: “Dee, I'm Audi.”</p><p>Dionne: “Bye.”</p><p><b><i>Baldwin</i></b>: A handsome or gorgeous man (the Baldwin brothers were hot in the mid-’90s.)</p><p>Context:</p><p>Cher: “OK, OK, so he is kind of a Baldwin.”</p><p><b><i>Betty:</i></b> A beautiful, timeless woman. Derived from the 1930s film star Betty Grable, the original pin-up girl.</p><p>Context:</p><p>Cher: “Wasn't my mom a total Betty? She died when I was young, a freak accident during a routine liposuction.”</p><p><b><i>Boinkfest:</i></b> A sexual encounter, perhaps an orgy.</p><p>Context:</p><p>Cher: “Here's the 411 on Mr. Hall: he's single, he's 47, and he earns minor duckets for a thankless job. What that man needs is a good healthy boinkfest.”</p><p><b><i>Buggin’: </i></b>Freaked out, upset, at a loss, confused.</p><p>Context:</p><p>Cher: “I said RSVP because it was a sit-down dinner. But people came that, like, did not RSVP, so I was, like, totally buggin'.”</p><p><b><i>Cake boy: </i></b>A gay man.</p><p>Context:</p><p>Murray: “Your man Christian is a cake boy!”</p><p>Cher/Dionne: “A what?”</p><p>Murray: “He's a disco-dancing, Oscar Wilde–reading, Streisand-ticket-holding friend of Dorothy. Know what I'm saying?”</p><p><b><i>Chin pubes:</i></b> Facial hair, particularly in reference to a goatee.</p><p>Context:</p><p>Josh: “I'm growing a goatee.”</p><p>Cher: “Oh, that's good. You don't want to be the last one at the coffee house without chin pubes."</p><p><b><i>Hagsville: </i></b>Ugly, disgusting, unattractive, grotesque.</p><p>Context:</p><p>Cher: “Let's ask a guy. Christian, what do you think of Amber?”</p><p>Christian: “Hagsville.”</p><p><b><i>Jeepin’</i></b>: cheating on a sexual partner.</p><p>Context:</p><p>Murray: “Where you been all weekend? What's up? You been jeepin' around behind my back?”</p><p><b><i>Loadie: </i></b>Someone who does drugs, a drug addict.</p><p>Context:</p><p>Cher: “Loadies generally hang on the grassy knoll over there.”</p><p><b><i>Monet: </i></b>Something that appears beautiful or attractive until you see it up close.</p><p>Context:</p><p>Cher: “No, she's a full on Monet.”</p><p>Tai: “What's a Monet?”</p><p>Cher: “It's like a painting, see? From far away, it's OK, but up close, it's a big old mess.”</p><p><b><i>Stems: </i></b>Legs, particularly slender and attractive.</p><p>Context:</p><p>Christian: “Nice stems.”</p><p><b><i>Surf the crimson wave:</i></b> A woman who is on her period.</p><p>Context:</p><p>Cher: “I object! Do you recall the dates of these alleged tardies?”</p><p>Mr. Hall: “One was last Monday!”</p><p>Cher: “Mr. Hall, I was surfing the crimson wave. I had to haul ass to the ladies’.”</p><p>Mr. Hall: “I assume you’re referring to women’s troubles, and so I’ll let that one slide.”</p><p><b><i>Wiggin’</i></b>: To freak out.</p><p>Context:</p><p>Cher: “This Josh and Tai thing was wiggin’ me more than anything. I mean, what was my problem? Tai is my pal. I don't begrudge her a boyfriend.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYmV%2BdHuPcGZqcV%2BYubaxy56qrGWXoby0v8CrsGaapZy0qrqMnJiknV2XvLp5zKipnmVpZXq0edKlmKefXZu%2FsLmMrZ%2BeZZaeua4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
