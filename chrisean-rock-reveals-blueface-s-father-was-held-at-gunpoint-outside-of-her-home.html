He went outside to get to his car as he needed to get to work. However, he couldn't do such a thing because his tires had been slashed. Furthermore, there were two men waiting for him, with their guns drawn. They were trying to get inside of the home so they could rob it. As Blueface's father explained, the two men ended up fleeing the scene. They did so after coming to the conclusion that Blueface's dad didn't have anything valuable on him.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-chrisean-rock-breaks-down-what-happened>Chrisean Rock Breaks Down What Happened</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Chrisean Rock continued her story by warning others about going to people's homes and trying to rob them. As she explained, she now has armed security outside of her house. She has a baby to take care of, and she doesn't want any intruders putting their safety at risk. Overall, it is an understandable position to have. No one wants to have their property stolen and they certainly don't want to deal with the trauma of a break-in. Hopefully, Chrisean is able to get her security to a place where she feels comfortable, moving forward.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-she-continues>She Continues</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">You can find the continuation of her story, below.
