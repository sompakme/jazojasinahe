As with any skin infection, in severe cases bacteria can enter your bloodstream and actually become life-threatening."</p><h2>Can you treat an infected tattoo at home?</h2>Wash the tattoo with clean water 2 times a day.

That's why very old tattoos turn green!<h2>How do you keep a black tattoo from turning green?</h2>Final Thoughts. Black ink can turn green as it ages.

These dark shades are dense and bold, making them less prone to fading. Vibrant and pastel colors like pink, yellow, light blue and green tend to fade faster.

However, when your skin's natural healing process might create imperfections in your tattoo. You will need some extra detailing to fix the issue.<h2>How long do tattoos last before they fade?</h2>Quality work won't fade so quickly, even when you slip-up (somewhat) on aftercare within the first 6-months.

At this point you can simply decide when it's time to bring some life back to the tattoo.<h2>Why does my new black tattoo look blue?</h2>But, Adal Ray of Majestic Tattoo NYC agrees, "It's simply the black ink being both absorbed by the body and fading over time, so there's less densely packed deposits of ink."<h2>Do modern tattoos fade?</h2>However, you must realize that most tattoos will fade at least somewhat once they're done peeling, and your tattoo will likely never look quite as vibrant as it did the very second you left the tattoo studio after your sitting.
