"I said one thing, and it went everywhere."</p><p>After host Josh Horowitz told Sweeney fans are excited for the new season, Sweeney said she's "excited too."</p><p>"I love Cassie. Cassie truly is a dream to play and as an actor, I’m so fortunate that I’ve had a character like her at such a young age," Sweeney added. "And, of course, I wanna keep living her crazy (life).
