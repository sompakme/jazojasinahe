It is not uncommon to see a used diesel truck for sale with over 200,000 miles on it. Granted, diesel engines typically have better reliability than a gasoline equivalent, but high mileage remains a concern.</p><p></p><h3>How many miles do diesel trucks last?</h3><p>A gasoline powered truck can run for 200,000 miles. Conversely, a diesel truck has a longer lifespan and can run for at least 500,000 and as much as 800,000 miles.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Does High Mileage matter on a diesel?</h3><p>Diesel Rule 1: NEVER buy high mileage To be clear – avoid diesel cars with over 100,000 miles on the clock. Just avoid them. Really. They will cost you money, time and hassle.</p><p></p><h3>Why do diesels last longer?</h3><p>Diesel engines do last longer than petrol ones. Diesel is a light oil and when burned and used as fuel by the vehicle it lubricates the parts of the engine. This prolongs the life of the engine. This is partly because of the intricate fuel pump which is expensive to repair or replace.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Why do truckers leave their engines running?</h3><p>Many truckers leave their trucks running to keep their engines warm. Therefore, many truckers will keep the trucks running to keep them warm and to keep oil and coolant circulating the motor. Extremely cold temperatures can create havoc on a truck running diesel. In fact, diesel fuel will thicken as it gets cold.</p><p></p><h3>Which diesel engine is the most reliable?</h3><p>Our Picks for the Best Diesel Pickup Truck Engines of the Last Two Decades Cummins. 6.7L 24-Valve.
