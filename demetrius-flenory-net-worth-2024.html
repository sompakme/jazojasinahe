His early life was marked by economic challenges, which played a significant role in shaping his future endeavors. Flenory’s initial foray into the world of business was not through legitimate means, as he became involved in street-level drug trafficking alongside his brother, Terry Flenory.</p><h3 id=the-rise-of-black-mafia-family-vdTQiwZzKk>The Rise of Black Mafia Family</h3><p>The Black Mafia Family (BMF), co-founded by Demetrius, was a large-scale drug trafficking organization that operated across the United States. During the peak of BMF’s operations, it was reported that the organization generated millions of dollars in revenue. This period marked the beginning of Flenory’s ascent to financial prominence, albeit through illicit activities.</p><h3 id=legal-issues-and-incarceration-vdTQiwZzKk>Legal Issues and Incarceration</h3><p>Flenory’s wealth accumulation was abruptly interrupted by legal troubles. In 2005, he was arrested and subsequently convicted on charges related to drug trafficking and money laundering.
