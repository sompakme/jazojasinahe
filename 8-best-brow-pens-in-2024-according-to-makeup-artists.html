<span class=val><a href=./categories/blog>blog</a></span></div><h1 class=headline itemprop=headline>8 Best Brow Pens in 2024, According to Makeup Artists</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>When I was around ten years old—long before I discovered the best brow pens or <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/g25560857/best-eyebrow-pencils/>eyebrow pencils</a>—I went with a friend to have Glamour Shots taken at the mall. I will never forget the pride I felt when the makeup artist told me my brows were "perfect"—a compliment I carried with me for years until I had two major realizations. First, that compliment was granted in the early 2000s, when "pencil-thin" eyebrows were a reigning <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/2024-makeup-trends/>beauty trend</a>. Second, that "perfect" is in the eye of the beholder, especially when it comes to brows. (And no, you can't see the photos.)</p><p>Don't get me wrong: I love my brows—even the half-blonde one that requires constant <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/makeup/g4892/best-eyebrow-tinting-products/>tinting</a> appointments. They're manageable, they fit my face, and I've never once dealt with an evil eyebrow hair growing where it's not welcome. And yet! There's a part of me that craves caterpillar-level brows. Unless I spring for a transplant, this will never happen, so the best brow pens have become my saving grace.</p><p>"Brow pens are an easy way to create a natural, fluffy brow with little effort," celebrity makeup artist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.instagram.com/glossipgirl/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Judi Gabbay Braha</a> tells Marie Claire. Specifically, they add more dimension by allowing you to target any sparse area with tiny, precise strokes of pigment. You see? Exactly what I'm looking for.</p><p>Ahead, I've consulted makeup experts to compile the very best brow pens—whether you have glamour shots coming up or not. I've also asked celebrity stylists to share the qualities defining brow pens that really work, and their tips for picture perfect application.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-to-look-for-in-a-brow-pen><span>What to Look For in a Brow Pen</span></h2><ul><li><strong>Applicator: </strong>Brow pens typically have a unique applicator that's incredibly fine, delivering a hair-like effect. "A brow pen is essentially a felt tip pen that helps to create hair-like strokes in a sparse area of your brows," Braha explains. These thin applicators, along with lighter pigments, give brows a more natural finish.</li><li><strong>Ease of use: </strong>Brow pens are famously easy to use—an excellent choice if you're just diving into the world of brow care. With most versions, you can create fuller brows by flicking the pen in light, upward strokes along the natural direction of your hair's growth.</li><li><strong>Waterproof: </strong>Fuller brows look great until you accidentally wipe them off. Double check that the brow pen's formula is long-lasting and resistant to water, sweat, and other unpredictable elements. "If you have oily skin and want the appearance of fuller brows, opt for a brow pen that is waterproof," celebrity makeup artist <a href=# data-url=https://www.instagram.com/elainabadro/https://www.instagram.com/elainabadro/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Elaina Badro</a> agrees.</li></ul><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-best-brow-pens><span>The Best Brow Pens</span></h2><a href=# data-model-name="KS&CO Microfeathering Brow Pen" data-url=https://theksandco.com/products/microfeathering-brow-pen referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=skimlinks data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1662120&xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheksandco.com%2Fproducts%2Fmicrofeathering-brow-pen&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marieclaire.com%2Fbeauty%2Fbest-brow-pens" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - theksandco.com" data-merchant-id=undefined data-merchant-url=undefined data-merchant-network=undefined><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vKK5wUdUmS7gLqEM86mJk4-1920-80.png><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Brow Pen Overall</span></p></a><p>KS&CO Microfeathering Brow Pen</p><p>My aesthetician turned me on to brow genius <a href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.instagram.com/kristiestreicher/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Kristie Streicher</a>'s brow pen, which must mean she really loves me—using this baby has considerably slowed down my need for tint appointments.

The product is pigmented but buildable, so if I fill in my brows but want certain spots to be darker I can fill in as needed to build in the spots. Second, the powder end is amazing for the chunky parts of the brow (it is a thick applicator, so not great for brow tails, but I think this is on purpose because the powder is much more pigmented than the brush). This really helps define and set the liquid makeup after I fill in my brows with the liquid brush applicator.
