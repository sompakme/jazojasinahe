She elaborates: "Key nutrients to highlight for hair health include iron, zinc, selenium, protein (amino acids), anti-inflammatory fats like olive oil and avocado, and antioxidants." Your hair may suffer if you're not getting enough of these nutrients in your diet. That's where supplements come in — to fill in the gaps and restore hair health.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We set out to find the best hair vitamins available.
