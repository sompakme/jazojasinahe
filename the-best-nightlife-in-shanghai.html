A century on, the red light bars and opium dens may be gone, but Shanghai remains an alluring prospect after dark. Slide onto a velvet bar stool at an atmospheric jazz bars, dress to the nines and strut around glamorous rooftops, or hang out in hip 'anti'-speakeasies gulping down punch. Here are a few options from China expert Lee Cobaj to get you started.</p><h3>The Bund</h3><h4>The Long Bar</h4><p>Opened in 1910 as a British gentlemen's club and now part of the beautifully restored Waldorf Astoria on The Bund, the Long Bar was the place to be during Shanghai's heyday. Its most famous imbiber: Noël Coward, who once laid his cheek against the bar's 110-feet of mahogany and declared that he could see the curvature of the earth in it. A century on, it's still a gorgeous spot for a sophisticated tipple, with teak panelled walls, aged leathers, swirling fans and one of the finest collections of whisky in town. Live music is performed most nights. &nbsp;</p><p><b>Contact:</b> 00 86 21 6322 9988; <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>hilton.com</a><br><b>Nearest metro:&nbsp;</b>East Nanjing Road<br><b>Opening times:</b> Mon-Sun, 4pm-1am<br><b>Price:</b> £££<br><b>Getting in:</b> Reservations recommended on weekends.

The crowd are affluent creative types – artists, fashion designers, writers – who regularly gather for cultural events, such as the Shanghai Literary Festival. Order a Saffron and Spice (saffron-infused brandy, apricot bitters, lemon, and star anise syprup) and work the room, admiring Glam's dazzling art collection (most of the pieces have come from the owner's private collection).</p><p><b>Contact: </b>00 86 21 6350 9988; <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>m-restaurantgroup.com</a><br><b>Nearest metro:&nbsp;</b>East Nanjing Road<br><b>Opening times: </b>Daily, 5pm-late<br><b>Price:</b> ££<br><b>Getting in: </b>Smart casual dress code</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>M Glam stands out with its striking décor</span></figure><p>•&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The best hotels in Shanghai</a></p><h4>Jazz Bar at the Fairmont Peace Hotel</h4><p>They've been a regular fixture for more than four decades, have a combined age of over 500 years and have played for dignitaries from across the globe including US presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton – the Old Jazz Band at the Art Deco <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fairmont Peace Hotel</a> are literally the oldest swingers in town. Settle into the Jazz Bar's plush Edwardian surroundings – dark woods, red velvets, gothic chandeliers, waiter in white tunics, the faint whiff of cigars – and listen to smooth renditions of 'Moon River' and 'Night and Day'. It's a little touristy but beautifully done.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>Contact:</b> 00 86 21 6321 6888; <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>fairmont.com</a><br><b>Nearest metro:</b>&nbsp;East Nanjing Road<br><b>Opening times:</b> Daily, 6pm-2am<br><b>Price:</b> £££<br><b>Getting in: </b>No reservations; smart casual dress code.

Sprawling across the roof terrace of a Bund-front building, the location is sensational, as are the views peering down the historic 'hood and out across the Huangpu River towards space-age Pudong. It's a packed-every-night-of-the-week kind of place, so dress to impress if you want to get past the velvet rope.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Contact: </b>00 86 21 6339 1199; <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>bar-rouge-shanghai.com</a><br><b>Nearest metro:</b>&nbsp;East Nanjing Road<br><b>Opening times:</b> Sun-Thur, 6pm-3am; Fri-Sat, 6pm-late<br><b>Price:&nbsp;</b>££<br><b>Getting in: </b>Reservations aren't required, but it's worth calling ahead to put your name on the guest list</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Bar Rouge has a sensational rooftop bar</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: gionnixxx/gionnixxx</span></figure><p>•&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">An insider guide to Shanghai</a></p><h3><br>Jing An</h3><h4>La Terrazza</h4><p>Draped across the 48th floor rooftop of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bulgari Hotel</a>, opening up onto 180 degrees of shimmering future-shock Shanghai, the exquisitely designed La Terrazza is a contender for one of the best rooftop bars in town. Aside from the panorama, the space itself is elegant and exclusive-feeling, with billowing cabanas, flickering candlelight, pretty greenery and silk-smooth service. Even if you can't afford Bulgari's £500 a night room rate, do come and savour at least one drink here. I recommend a Pink Lady, an enigmatic mix of vodka, Sichuan pepper syrup, dragon fruit, egg white and lemon juice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>Contact: </b>00 86 21 3319 6188; <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>bulgarihotels.com</a><br><b>Nearest metro:</b> Yuyuan Garden<br><b>Opening times: </b>Daily, 6pm-11pm<br><b>Price: </b>£££<br><b>Getting in:</b> Business/smart dress code</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>The impressive La Terrazza is draped across the 48th floor rooftop of the Bulgari hotel</span></figure><p>•&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The best hotels in Hong Kong</a></p><h4>Logan's Punch</h4><p>An 'anti'-speakeasy, Logan's Punch is bolshy bar housed in the happening Taixing Lu complex just off Nanjing Road. The music is loud, the crowd lively and the woody interiors have the feel of backyard den, full of little cubby holes you can hide in with friends and slurp up giant bowls of punch. In summer, order the Punch Drunk Love, a breezy blend of gin, sliced orange, grapefruit and soda. In the cooler months, try the warming Hot Apple Punch, made with honey-bourbon, apple juice, cinnamon and cloves.</p><p><b>Address:</b> 99 Taixing Road<br><b>Contact:</b> 00 86 21 6248 5928<br><b>Nearest metro: </b>Nanjing West Road<br><b>Price:</b> ££<br><b>Opening times: </b>Mon-Sat, 5pm-1am<br><b>Getting in:</b> No reservations; no dress code</p><p>•&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The best things to do in Hong Kong</a></p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>The loud and lively Logan's Punch serves fruity punches</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: dirk weiblen</span></figure><h3><br>Pudong</h3><h4>Flair Bar</h4><p>Drinks at Flair Bar are not something you're going to forget in a hurry – the ray gun-shaped Pearl Tower feels close enough to reach out and grab, the Huangpu River ready to dip your toes into, The Bund a vision of majestic columns, domes and clock towers.
