In 2016</span><span>,</span><span> she started making eyeglasses as part of her collection after she began having to wear them herself.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Gwen</span><span> also became a notable face in the makeup world thanks to her signature red lip and perfect porcelain skin. In 2011</span><span>,</span><span> she became a spokesperson for L’Oreal Paris and collaborated with Urban Decay </span><span>a few years later</span><span> to create her own collection in 2016. She also kicked off a very successful Vegas residency in 2018.</span></p><p><span>Of course, her most notable gig besides music has to be her role as a coach on</span> <a href=#><i><span>The Voice</span></i></a><span>. She first appeared on season 7 in 2014, replacing</span> <a href=#><b>Christina Aguilera</b></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Quickly becoming a fan favorite, Gwen went on to act as a coach for seasons&nbsp; 9, 12, 17</span> <span>and 19, and an advisor on seasons 8 and 10.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And thanks to meeting a special someone on set, </span><i><span>The Voice</span></i><span> became much more to her than </span><span>just an opportunity to help other performers on the rise.</span></p><p><span>After the singer got divorced in 2015 from</span> <a href=#><b>Gavin Rossdale</b></a><span> — with whom she shares sons Kingston, Zuma</span> <span>and Apollo — she</span><a href=#> <span>moved on</span></a><span> with fellow TV judge</span> <a href=#><b>Blake Shelton</b></a><span>. After five years of dating, the country crooner</span> <a href=#><span>finally popped the question</span></a><span> in 2020.</span></p><p><span>“Hey @gwenstefani thanks for saving my 2020 … And the rest of my life.&nbsp; I love you. I heard a YES!” he wrote beside an</span><a href=#><span> Instagram</span></a><span> photo of Gwen flaunting her new ring on October 27.</span></p><p><span>“</span><a href=#><span>The engagement happened</span></a><span> at the chapel Blake built for Gwen on the grounds of their Oklahoma home,” an insider exclusively told</span><i><span> In Touch</span></i><span> about the proposal, adding, “Blake got down on one knee.” Gwen is “over the moon” to spend the</span> <a href=#><span>rest of her life with her beau.&nbsp;</span></a></p><p><span>Since that romantic engagement, </span><a href=#><span>Blake and Gwen’s dream wedding</span></a><span> “came together without a hitch,” a source told </span><i><span>In Touch</span></i><span>, and the happy pair were married on July 3, 2021, in an intimate ceremony on Blake’s Oklahoma ranch.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Gwen shared some pictures of the nuptials on </span><a href=#><span>Instagram</span></a><span> with the caption, “Dreams do come true!”</span></p><p><b>Scroll through the gallery below to see her epic transformation from rocker chick to happy bride!</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTqKycoKeasqy42GeaqKVfpby0wNJonrCdnmLAtbHFmqWiZaSnrq%2B%2FxaipppmknryvedKenGaomKTBsL%2BMrZ%2Bepl2Wu6V5zaiuaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
