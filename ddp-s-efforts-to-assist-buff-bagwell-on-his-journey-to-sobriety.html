However, once the company folded Buff struggled to get back into the wrestling scene <a href=#>due his issues dealing with substance abuse</a>. The former WCW star had tough time staying sober <a href=#>which led to multiple run-ins with the law</a>. Fortunately, It seems Buff is starting to get back on his feet.</p><p>WWE Hall of Famer Diamond Dallas Page recently discussed working with Buff and helping him stay sober. While talking to <a href=#>“MMA Hour”</a>, DDP said he always considered Buff a “good friend,” despite his serious addiction problem. He described that dealing with Buff’s problems was a “lot of work,” but he was happy to do it.</p><p>“Marcus [Bagwell], who I’ve always considered a good friend, but Marcus had serious addiction problems, and Marcus, you know, he’ll tell you he’s a lot of work –- I’m a lot of work! You know, but he was a lot of work.”</p><p>Moving on in the discussion, DDP revealed that Buff had contacted him first about working towards sobriety. However, DDP was initially hesitant to help the veteran due to his recent remarriage and he didn’t want to deal with any “rocky patches.” At the end, DDP changed his mind and decided to help Buff through his journey to sobriety.</p><p>“I just got remarried, I don’t want to have any rocky patches, but I’m working on something, and I’m working on this thing with my business partner ‘Change or Die,’ but if we do it, you’ll be the first person I call. And that’s how it happened.”</p><p>DDP admitted that Buff has come a long way since then and has successfully fought his way through substance abuse. He further said that the hardest thing for an addict is to stop being “delusional” about their addiction and Buff didn’t want to be that guy. It’s surely nice to see Buff acknowledging the problem and working to better himself.</p><p>“The hardest thing an addict has to deal with is stop being so delusional, and realize you’re an addict. See, Jake didn’t wanna be that guy. Marcus didn’t wanna be the guy that he’d become.”</p><p>In case you need a refresher, Buff was <a href=#>arrested on the charge of DUI last year</a>. He also got ticket for speeding on top of that. It appears, he has learnt his lesson and is making strides towards that right direction. We’ll have to wait and see what he does next.
