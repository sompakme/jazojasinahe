Two years after having Issac, Kailyn welcomed Lincoln to the world; he’s now 11. It would be another five years before she had her next son, Lux, and another three years before baby Creed was born in 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2023, Kailyn surprised fans by announcing she had been keeping her new pregnancy a secret, but had welcomed a new, healthy boy to the family, Rio, in November 2022.&nbsp;As for the twins, fans are still waiting to meet the little ones. After announcing the birth of Rio, she then <a href=#>told her “Barely Famous” podcast listeners</a>&nbsp; she was pregnant for the sixth time after leaving a Thailand vacation with “permanent souvenirs”.</p><p>Now, as far as we know (because this is what Kailyn has told fans!) the reality star will be welcoming a set of twins when she gives birth.</p><p>However, fan theories had been popping up all over social media, including the comment section of Kailyn’s posts, and many think she may be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">welcoming her first girl</a>.</p><p>One fan account has gone so far as to suggest they even know the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">names of the twins</a> – Iverson and Valley!

When Kailyn got pregnant as a teenager, it was with her high school sweetheart, Jo Rivera. The two have remained amicable through the years.&nbsp;</p><p>Then she met Javi Marroquin, who she married in 2012, and the pair welcomed Lincoln shortly after. The relationship did not last, and the pair divorced in 2017. Not too long after, Kailyn welcomed her son Lux with Chris Lopez. Their relationship was tumultuous, to say the least, but despite being on-again, off-again, they did another kid together: son Creed in July 2020.</p><p>Kailyn moved on with now boyfriend Elijah Scott after splitting from Chris, and they welcomed their first, Rio, in November 2022.</p><p>The following year, she revealed she was pregnant with twins with Elijah.</p><h2 id=h-kailyn-expecting-baby-8>Kailyn Expecting Baby #8?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/classic-kailyn-1.jpg><p>But she’s not done yet –<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> or is she</a>? Kailyn admitted on an episode of her podcast, Barely Famous, that she has a plan to have another baby, but this time, with a surrogate.</p><p>Teen Mom fans will remember Bone Estrada, Kailyn’s friend of many years, from the show. During a recent episode of Kailyn’s Barely Famous podcast, the pair revealed a plan they hatched for the MTV bestie to carry a child for the ex reality TV personality.</p><p>“You just know when you’re not done having kids and you know when you are done having kids. So there was a point where I had said that I was not done having children – we’re gonna do gender selection – and then Bone was going to carry my children or child,” the mom-of-seven said.</p><p>She went on: “An Elijah [Scott] was on board. I don’t know if your boyfriend was on board.” Bone then revealed that she “had already agreed to it” when she met her new man and had no plans to back out of the deal if that was something Kailyn wanted.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tsX2V%2BcLfAoqOypl2hvLi%2B2GaiopyjZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
