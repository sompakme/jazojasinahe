Why? Why?"</p><p>The skater, of course, was 24-year-old Olympic hopeful Nancy Kerrigan, who'd just been hit in the kneecap with a police baton by a man who fled the scene. During the investigation following Kerrigan's attack, authorities quickly discovered that the assault had been planned by Jeff Gillooly, the ex-husband of Kerrigan's chief rival, 23-year-old Tonya Harding.</p><p>The incident is two decades old, but the shock of the attack—and the trial and media frenzy that followed— still ranks among the biggest sports scandals in modern history, and has unusually strong pop culture staying-power.

The truth may never be known, but the facts, tangled though they may be, are worth a review.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9Ev3QYC3GRUFQSnUwBijYR-1920-80.jpg><p>In the early 1990s, Kerrigan and Harding were both rising stars in the figure skating world, often competing against one another in national championships.

Kerrigan took home bronze at that competition.</p><p>But despite Harding having a&nbsp;slight&nbsp;competitive edge on the ice, Kerrigan had her beat when it came to public image. Her classic looks and poised persona led to lucrative deals with sponsors like Campbell's, Revlon, and Reebok—and while Harding's fans&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.buzzfeed.com/whitneyjefferson/things-you-can-find-on-tonya-hardings-web-page?utm_term=.dfGOQjwEp#.up662gJ4z" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>were dedicated and hardcore</a>, she lacked sponsors and endorsement deals.

The skater was practicing at Detroit's Cobo Arena, hoping to do well in the U.S. Championships the following day in order to qualify for the Olympics in Norway—just six weeks away. Unexpectedly, she was&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/sports/year_in_sports/01.06.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>hit in the right kneecap</a>&nbsp;by a masked assailant, resulting in a bruise and a limp—but not a fracture or break. While Kerrigan&nbsp;was&nbsp;granted a spot on the Olympic team, she was unable to compete in the U.S. Championships, and Harding won as a result. She wasn't exactly subtle about her enthusiasm for the win, and during an on-camera interview said "<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=http://commerce.wazeedigital.com/license/clip/1B17324_0079.do referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>I'm gonna whip her butt</a>" when asked about competing against Kerrigan at the Olympics.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

The latter did the best skate of her career, and took home the silver medal. Harding, on the other hand,&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-02-26/news/9402260180_1_figure-skating-competition-tonya-harding-lace referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>choked</a>. Not only did she fail to land her first jump, she started crying and told judges she'd broken a lace during warmup, causing her to skate poorly. She was granted a re-do, but finished eighth.</p><p>After the '94 Olympics, neither Harding nor Kerrigan skated competitively ever again. Upon returning to the US,&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=http://www.oregonlive.com/tonya-harding/1994/03/tonya_hardings_plea_guilty_ska.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Harding pleaded guilty</a>&nbsp;to conspiring to hinder prosecution—i.e., learning about the attack after the fact and not telling the FBI what she knew. She avoided jail time, but received three years probation and was fined $100,000. Meanwhile, the U.S. Figure Skating Association barred Harding from competition and stripped of her championship titles. Her career as a figure skater was over.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2vukzgNuoC3dZXEVsxEEnU-1920-80.jpg><p>More than two decades on, Gillooly (who's since changed his name to Jeff Stone) maintains<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=http://deadspin.com/finding-gillooly-what-happened-to-figure-skatings-inf-1482669790 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>that Harding knew</a>about the attack all along, which she's always staunchly denied. The two had a troubled marriage—Harding says Gillooly abused her, and twice filed restraining orders against him. At the time of Kerrigan's attack, the pair had divorced,&nbsp;but&nbsp;they were still living together.</p><p>So, was Harding involved in the planning of Kerrigan's attack? File this one with D.B. Cooper and the Zodiac Killer, because it's likely we'll never know for sure. Skating fans and scandal voyeurs alike will have to wait until next year to see how much Robbie's iteration of Harding knew, and when, exactly, she knew it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LzKh5ELsGMVmqAzstFUvTc-1920-80.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiZYmqDdYWOraansZFitaK%2Bw6KloGWelrukxYyknKuqmZyur3nFnqydZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
