On Thursday, the first to get the&nbsp;Big Brother&nbsp;boot this season was revealed.</p><p><strong>PHOTOS&nbsp;<a href=#>‘Big Brother 16’: Meet the&nbsp;Houseguests</a></strong></p><p>Who got the unlucky title as the first evictee of season 16? It was between&nbsp;<strong>Joey Van Pelt</strong>, ironically the first of a three-member Team America alliance (as voted by viewers), and&nbsp;<strong>Paola “PaoPao” Shea</strong>, the New York DJ who counts using her fingers. Not surprisingly, Joey got the boot by a unanimous 13-0 vote.</p><p><strong>Team America Twist Fizzles (and Hi, Alex)</strong></p><p>Right off the bat, one of the&nbsp;Big Brother&nbsp;twists — Team America — which asks viewers to vote for each member of a three-person alliance is in jeopardy with Joey the main target after the Bomb Squad caught wind that she was attempting to form an all-girl alliance. Knowing she’s in deep trouble, Joey starts to campaign for votes but things aren’t going to be easy with some members (namely&nbsp;<strong>Devin</strong>) wanting a unanimous vote. Devin then makes the rounds to assure that the votes for Joey to leave are 13-0, which begins to rub the other&nbsp;houseguests&nbsp;the wrong way. Meanwhile,&nbsp;houseguests&nbsp;like&nbsp;<strong>Brittany&nbsp;</strong>believe Devin and&nbsp;<strong>Caleb&nbsp;</strong>are controlling the house. (She’s right, for the most part.)</p><p><strong>PHOTOS&nbsp;<a href=#>‘Big Brother 16’: First Look at the New House</a></strong></p><p>In a desperate attempt to win over votes and to communicate to the other&nbsp;houseguests&nbsp;to vote for themselves, Joey creates an alter ego, “Alex” — complete with a bulge, five o’clock shadow and Hayden’s clothes (a plaid shirt, orange beanie, khaki shorts). And based on how the&nbsp;houseguests&nbsp;reacted, it’s likely Joey’s&nbsp;unique&nbsp;plea for votes didn’t quite pull off its intended effect.</p><p><strong>Caleb’s Heart Go Boom</strong></p><p>Is Caleb a 13-year-old girl? An entire segment is dedicated to Caleb’s infatuation with&nbsp;<strong>Amber</strong>, whom Caleb calls “my girl.” Later, Caleb and Amber bond in the HOH and things are promising, with the two connecting over the Bible. But when Caleb tells her that he’s noticed that she looks at him “a lot” — and that’s when things get weird. While Amber admits in her Diary Room session that she probably won’t ever return Caleb’s feelings, there’s an ounce of (delusional) hope on his end. “Did I make her day?”&nbsp;Awkward.</p><p><strong>Q&A&nbsp;<a href=#>‘Big Brother’ Producers on Controversy, Bigger Competitions and ‘Twisted’ Season 16</a></strong></p><p><strong>The Vote Breakdown</strong></p><p>Devin: Joey<br><strong>Derrick</strong>: Joey<br><strong>Frankie</strong>: Joey<br><strong>Cody</strong>: Joey<br>Zach: Joey<br>Brittany: Joey<br><strong>Nicole</strong>: Joey<br><strong>Christine</strong>: Joey<br><strong>Victoria</strong>: Joey<br><strong>Jacosta</strong>: Joey<br><strong>Hayden</strong>: Joey<br>Amber: Joey<br><strong>Donny</strong>: Joey</p><p>In Joey’s exit interview with&nbsp;<strong>Julie Chen,</strong>&nbsp;she admitted it was difficult being in the house. “People start getting quieter, secretive, clique-y. It’s like going back to the insecurities of7th&nbsp;grade.” Joey also criticized the&nbsp;houseguests&nbsp;lack of balls in making a big move (it is only Week 1, after all), saying she wished they would have done something to shake up the house (again, it’s only Week 1).</p><p>Chen also asked about her strategy to confess about trying to form an all-girl alliance when&nbsp;houseguests&nbsp;usually deny. Joey’s response: “I thought everybody knew about the all-girl alliance, so I said, ‘Screw it!’ It was comedic relief.” After Joey found out that there were two women in the Bomb Squad, she correctly guessed Amber but believed&nbsp;Jacosta&nbsp;was in on the game. (The second member is Christine.)</p><p><strong>New&nbsp;HOHs</strong></p><p>In the Greek-themed HOH<strong>&nbsp;</strong>competition, “BB&nbsp;Rager,” the women and men compete in separate competitions, which asks them to stack six kegs in front of the frat house.Houseguests<strong>&nbsp;</strong>not competing in the competition in the balcony can throw Frisbees.</p><p>The women compete first, with Brittany the first one eliminated from the competition. Who was crowned the first HOH of the week? Amber&nbsp;Borzotra.</p><p>The men compete second in the same setup and it’s a battle between Hayden Voss and Cody&nbsp;Calafiore, with Cody squeaking out the win. But not so fast! The producers review the tapes and Cody’s foot touched the ground before he hit the button, meaning it’s<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Devin Shepherd is the new co-HOH. Chalk it up to the&nbsp;Big Brother&nbsp;gods for giving Devin, who really needed this, this win.</p><p><strong>Team America</strong></p><p>Who is the second … sorry, first member of Team America? Donny Thompson. (Hey, at least Devin and Caleb’s belief that Donny is a&nbsp;superspy&nbsp;is now accurate!)</p><p>Who do you think Amber and Devin will put up for eviction? Do you think Cody is better off not winning the co-HOH?</p><p>Big Brother&nbsp;next airs 8&nbsp;p.m. Sunday on CBS.</p><p>Email:&nbsp;Philiana.Ng@THR.com<br>Twitter:&nbsp;@Insidethetube</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOm6CgZZKnvLW0xKtkam5dn7ymxYyvmKdlZ2aDd4GRaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
