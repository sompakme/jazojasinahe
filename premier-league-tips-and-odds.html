Both teams have scored in all 13 of the Seagulls’ Premier League assignments this term.</p><p><b>Chelsea vs Brighton tip 2:</b> Over 3.5 goals @ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">5/4 with Sky Bet</a></p><h3>Pedro can cause problems for hosts</h3><p>Punters should begin their bet builder for this contest with over 2.5 goals, given that Brighton’s league fixtures are averaging 3.92 goals per game – the highest figure in the entire division.</p><p>Both teams have looked suspect at the back but offer a decent threat going forward, so that punt should not disappoint.</p><p>If Brighton do find a way through the Blues, Joao Pedro is a likely candidate to hit the net and worth selecting to have at least two shots on target in west London.</p><p>Only Kaoru Mitoma (22) has managed more shots in the league for Brighton than Pedro (19) this term and the Brazilian has scored three times in his previous two games for the Seagulls.</p><p>Complete the bet builder with the visitors to have four or more corners at Stamford Bridge this afternoon.</p><p>The Seagulls have racked up 69 corners in the top flight this term, meaning they are averaging 5.3 per game, and the absence of Chelsea full back James could provide them with even more opportunities down the flank.</p><p><b>Chelsea vs Brighton tip 3: </b>Over 2.5 goals, Joao Pedro 2+ shots on target and Brighton to have 4+ corners @ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">5/1 with Sky Bet</a></p><h3>Chelsea vs Brighton odds</h3><p>Odds are correct at the time of publication and subject to change.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaJqVqcGqusZonainpJeurbiOnJ%2BepKOarm7C0maZq6GXncGwuoypqZ6cmZjBqrvNZquiqKNigG6wxJycppqVp3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
