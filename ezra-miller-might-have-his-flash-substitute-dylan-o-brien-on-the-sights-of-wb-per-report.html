He's a mainstay of the <strong>DCEU</strong>, and it was expected that he'd be in a lot more movies in the future.</p><p>However, given the allegations leveled against <strong>Ezra Miller</strong>, as well as several arrests, everyone is aware that many other actors have had their contracts canceled for far less. In light of this, we've learned that <strong>Warner Bros. is considering his options for replacing Ezra Miller.</strong></p><p>It's unclear how many actors have topped WB's list for The Flash's replacement. However, a source close to the situation has told Screengeek.com that one such name is <strong>Dylan O'Brien.</strong> The 30-year-old actor is best known for his roles in television and film, including <strong>Teen Wolf </strong>on MTV, <strong>Love and Monsters</strong>, and <strong>The Maze Runner</strong> series.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Wasn't Grant Gustin the favorite to replace Miller?</h2><p>On the other hand, fans have their own ideas about who the next Flash might be. Actor <strong>Grant Gustin </strong>is a popular choice. He's a no-brainer because he's already portrayed <strong>The Flash </strong>on The <strong>CW's Arrowverse.</strong></p><p>However, transferring Grant Gustin from the Arrowverse to the DCEU could be difficult. It's not as if those respective continuities haven't already crossed.</p><p>In any case, it might be best to replace <strong>Ezra Miller</strong> with someone new, such as Dylan O'Brien. Although it's unclear how such a shift will fit into the DCEU's overall story. However, with Warner Bros. Discovery eager to overhaul the property, there could be a variety of changes that make it work.</p><p>As a result, we'll have to wait and see what happens with Ezra Miller, as well as Warner Bros.' final decision.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqWgn52jqcatsY6mpq%2Bhlah8c3yRa2ZpbV9mfXCCkXBwcnGRl7Jzg49tnG9waGuFo4CUnJ1noKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
