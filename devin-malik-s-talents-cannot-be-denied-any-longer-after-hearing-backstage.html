Most people first heard of this guy just months ago, as he had major contributions to <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>ScHoolboy Q</a>'s album of the year candidate, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">BLUE LIPS</a>. The Philadelphia, Pennsylvania product had loads of production credits, including "oHio", "First", "Smile", and "Nunu". In terms of rap performances, fans could hear him on "Back n Love", as well as <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"Love Birds"</a>. Devin certainly made a name for himself this year, but he also has worked with other major names like <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Isaiah Rashad</a>, playing more of a behind-the-scenes role on <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">The House Is Burning</a>. But, Devin Malik is out to continue to prove he is not just a <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>TDE</a> affiliate, dropping a new single called "BACKSTAGE".</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This is one of three singles this year, and just his fifth of his solo career. His first offering was the more straightforward trap/pop rap banger "LINK DUCKER". That came out almost one year ago exactly, hitting platforms in August. But back to 2024 output, Devin has put out "CANADIAN TUX", an aggressive and braggadocious cut produced by Working On Dying and F1LTHY. Then, we would get "PDA", a more subdued melodic track about love and yearning for it. This brings us to "BACKSTAGE", perhaps Devin's most bouncy and danceable single to date. Here, the rising star is introducing a girl from outside of L.A. (where he resides now) and having her accompany him on his day in the city. It is certainly a summer-ready joint that looks to be a fun moment on his debut project, DEADSTOCK, Before that drops on June 28, be sure to check out the rest of his catalog, as well as "BACKSTAGE" with the link.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdoZoN6g5Fmm56umaN6rq3LoqJmmpGYuLTAwKCcZqCZpXqpu89mpZ6vow%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
