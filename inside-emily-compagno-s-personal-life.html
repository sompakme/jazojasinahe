Maybe it's because of her legal background, or maybe it's because she has over <a href=#>300,000 followers on social media</a>, but one thing is for sure — Compagno is not one to share details about her life or husband — despite sporting a rock on her left finger.</p><p dir=ltr>But here's what we do know. The Fox News personality is married to Peter Riley, a well-known <a href=#>real estate agent and broker</a> in Vancouver, Washington with Berkshire Hathaway Home Service Northwest Real Estate. Yet, while Riley may have a license in the Pacific Northwest for work, we can infer that the real estate agent is either from California or has roots in the Golden State, as he and Compagno met as teenagers — with Compagno <a href=#>being born and raised California</a>.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>According to <a href=#>The U.S. Sun</a>, Riley and Compagno knew of each other from a young age, but it wasn't until they happened to see each other on a Seattle sidewalk years later that they reconnected. From there, it was simply love at first sight. Yet, when these two started dating they certainly didn't know what was to come in their relationship — fame, success, notoriety, <a href=#>or Fox News</a> — so, are these two still together?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmtoaIFye8inqqKclWKyrrXLsmScp52lrqi6zqxkqZ2iqLyvrctmo6KelWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
