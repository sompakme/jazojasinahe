The actor revealed this week he nearly lost hope for the project when he heard his name in contention with <a href=# id=auto-tag_leonardo-dicaprio_1 data-tag=leonardo-dicaprio>Leonardo DiCaprio</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Christensen played Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars: Attack of the Clones (2002) and Star Wars: The Revenge of the Sith (2005).</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“It just seemed too big,” Christensen recalled of the chance to audition for the role in a recent interview with <a rel=nofollow href=#>Empire</a> magazine. He was 18 at the time, and asked his agent: “Is there maybe another role that they’re also casting right now that you can put me up&nbsp;for? Because Anakin sort of seems unattainable.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The imposter syndrome continued, Christensen said, when he learned that Leonardo DiCaprio was also in talks for the role. “That just confirmed my thought that the role would go to another actor,” he said. “Through the entire auditioning process I had told myself, from day one, that I wasn’t going to get the part. It just wasn’t a possibility. And&nbsp;I think that probably helped me a lot, because it just freed me up in a lot of ways. And so it really came as a surprise to me when I got the part.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">DiCaprio told ShortList in 2015 that <a href=# id=auto-tag_george-lucas_1 data-tag=george-lucas>George Lucas</a> offered him the role of Anakin, but he turned it down, saying he “just didn’t feel ready to take that dive.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Christensen understands DiCaprio’s perspective, telling Empire “the scope of the opportunity” was exciting, but also daunting. “There a saying,” he added: “Pressure is privilege.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I just felt very lucky to have it,” the actor continued. “I was really thrilled that I was gonna get to express George’s mapping out of how someone goes from good to bad.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKmt2J2cp2WTnb%2Bqv9OepaydnmLAta3RZq6aqqNiuaa7zZqpnaddmbakrc%2BroKhlYWeAdoSTaWlxcV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
