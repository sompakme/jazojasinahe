Never more apparent than in that iconic, one-of-a-kind&nbsp;Colombo&nbsp;scene where Peter Falk falls (Purposefully? Accidentally?) down a very steep hill.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s the stuff of legend, the highlight of the episode “The Greenhouse Jungle,” and one of the highlights of the entire series.</p><p>Encouraged to take the “quickest way down” to the scene of a car crash by the ever-eager Sergeant Wilson, Columbo’s comical expression of confusion precedes his hilarious stumbling, then collapsing, down the slope. Our favorite detective collapsed in a heap at the hill’s dusty bottom.</p><p><strong>Columbo’s comical expression of confusion precedes his hilarious stumbling, then collapsing, down the slope.</strong></p><p>One of Colombo’s greatest lines–arguably an ad-lib–follows: “I’ll tell ya–it was the quickest way down.”&nbsp;Indeed it was.&nbsp;</p><p>Undeniably, the various camera angles demonstrate that, in this case, Falk is performing his own painful-looking stunt. The film additionally appears not to have been sped up, a hallmark of stunt footage. Whether Colombo purposefully performed the tumble or Peter Falk genuinely slipped and toppled remains a mystery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/colombo-900x506.png><p>“The Greenhouse Jungle” features Tony Goodland, a villain strapped for cash to impress his wife with. He and his uncle Jarvis devise a complex-yet-moronic scheme revolving around a fake kidnapping. To stage the abduction, they shoot a gun through Tony’s car window, then shove said car over a ravine.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Tony, ever the criminal mastermind, hides in a cabin, awaiting the ransom money.&nbsp;</p><p>Colombo arrives on the scene, joined by the anti-Colombo/foil Sergeant Wilson, a well-trained, normie police officer. Following Colombo’s incredible descent down the hill, he examines the car crash, concluding–amidst quintessentially Peter Falk facial expressions of incredulity–that something is suspicious.</p><p><strong>Following Colombo’s incredible descent down the hill, he examines the car crash, concluding that something is suspicious.</strong></p><p>For his part, Jarvis fakes cooperation and secures the ransom money by pinching it from Tony’s trust fund (!). As planned, he performs the ransom drop; contrary to plans, he murders Tony before framing Tony’s wife, Cathy, for the killing.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, Columbo harbors suspicion of Jarvis, particularly upon observing how much the victim’s uncle despises his nephew. Soon, after employing modern police techniques, in this case, a metal detector, Columbo discovers a bullet in Jarvis’s greenhouse.</p><p>As expected, Jarvis’s plan goes awry, as Colombo/Peter Falk ace the case through that classic blend of shrewd observation, dogged investigation, and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">comedy</a>–unveiling the dark truth behind what appeared to be a standard kidnapping.&nbsp;</p><p>All after, Columbo almost breaks his neck, falling down a double-black diamond-level slope.&nbsp;</p><p>Columbo&nbsp;aired primarily from 1968 to 1978, with sporadic episodes airing and exciting fans until 2003. The series still enjoys renown for its unique format and, of course, Falk’s iconic performance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screen-Shot-2024-01-02-at-8.48.30-AM-900x526.png><p>Unlike traditional mystery series,&nbsp;Colombo&nbsp;utilized a so-called “howcatchem” format–rather than a “whodunit” format most stereotypical cop shows rely on. Each episode commences by revealing both the crime and the perpetrator, thus foregoing the element of surprise; the audience need not guess the killer’s identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, they sit back and watch&nbsp;Columbo’s&nbsp;star actor, Peter Falk, impressively solve the case with his unassuming demeanor and razor-sharp detective skills. Sometimes, additionally, they watch him fall down a hill.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2iolamys3nFmqOkZZOkuba5wahkn5mcoXupwMyl</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
