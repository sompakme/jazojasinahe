His second album, What You See Is What You Get, continued to dominate the airways and charts. Due to the success, Combs announced on <a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;that a deluxe version,&nbsp;titled What You See Ain't Always What You Get, was scheduled for release that October. The expanded record would come with five new songs from the country star.</p><p>Sharing all the remaining stops on the rescheduled What You See Is What You Get tour that July, Combs revealed on <a href=#>Instagram</a> that his last show of the initial tour was in Europe, before the tour was cut short. "Playing shows for y'all is what I love to do, but I want y'all to be completely safe," he explained. "... I can't wait to see y'all in person next year."</p><p>Once again, 2020 saw the Country Music Awards recognize Combs for his tremendous talent. The award show nominated the singer-songwriter in major categories like entertainer of the year, album of the year, and song of the year. In an Instagram <a href=#>post</a>&nbsp;that September, Combs thanked his team, family, and fans for all their help and support, writing, "None of this is possible without any of you. WE did this. THANK YOU!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmanFhaIF3e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5y66inmWTpLqjv44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
