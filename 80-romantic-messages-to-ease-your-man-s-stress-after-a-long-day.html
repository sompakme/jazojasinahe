However, the type of romantic message does matter. Knowing your partner is important because you can understand what kind of message to send them to make them feel better after a long day. You will be able to tailor your message to best suit your partner. You would know if your partner is someone that the romantic message has to include a joke that would make them laugh and relax or if the romantic message has to be one appreciating their hard work. Physical gestures could differ based on your partner. Some people may find physical touch to ease stress, some may find a simple massage to alleviate stress, and some may find a simple hug to ease their stress. You need to ask yourself, what would my partner prefer to ease their stress physically as what may work for person A may not work for person B.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/11760bfb298ed4ec.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ good Discord bio ideas to put in the ‘about me’ section</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Here are some heartfelt messages that will lift his spirits.</p><h3 id=1468680-bet-words-to-comfort-someone-who-is-stressed class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Bet words to comfort someone who is stressed</h3><p class=align-left>Many people struggle with stress either at work or in their personal life.
