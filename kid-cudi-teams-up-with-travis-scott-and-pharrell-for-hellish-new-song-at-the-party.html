Overall, this is a project that fans have been waiting for. It has been teased quite a bit, and it was even <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">supposed to be released in September. </a>However, Cudi decided to delay the project until next year. Furthermore, it has been said that this album could contain over 40 tracks. It remains to be seen whether or not that is actually going to happen. However, you can't help but feel like it might just be a real possibility.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">That said, today, Kid Cudi decided to bless his fans with some brand-new music. In fact, the track contains features from some of the biggest artists. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Pharrell</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Travis Scott</a> are on the song, which is called "At The Party." You can listen to this new joint below, and as you will hear, it has a futuristic yet hellish sound to it. The Pharrell production is quite dark, and it offers up a cyberpunk-esque vibe that a lot of fans are going to enjoy.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kid-cudi-x-pharrell-x-travis-scott>Kid Cudi x Pharrell x Travis Scott</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This song has Pharrell starting us off as his signature production carries the song forward. Subsequently, Kid Cudi comes in and his vocals are in that pocket fans know him for. These two artists work well together, and once Travis Scott comes in, the song is raised to another level. Overall, it is a great effort from all four.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Be sure to let us know what you think of this new Cudi song, in the comments section below.
