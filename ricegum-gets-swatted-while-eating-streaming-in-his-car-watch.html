The Las Vegas native, of Vietnamese and Chinese descent, was making rap diss tracks against his peers at the peak of their Internet hype. One could say that he was among the first to popularize them for better or worse, leading to the chaotic, often scrutinized, but always eye-catching landscape we see today.</p><p>Unfortunately for the 26-year-old, it looks like he recently fell victim to a dangerous and years-long trend in content streaming: <a href=# rel>swatting</a>.
