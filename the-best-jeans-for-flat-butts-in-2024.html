From thong pants to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>butt-lifting leggings</a>, all the buzziest products are promising a bigger and better butt. For those with less mass in the region, this focus on the derriere can be a little bit discouraging. But have no fear, there's actually a simpler solution than squats or booty creams to enhancing your assets: the right pair of jeans.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We asked several stylists whether jeans can make your butt look bigger, and the answer was a resounding, yes. With the right fit and details, like pockets and fading, jeans can make a flat butt look rounder and perkier. In addition to booty-boosting features, we looked for durable materials and inclusive sizing. Recommended by fashion stylists and editors, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Levi's Wedgie Straight Fit Jeans</a> lift and define your backside with a high rise and strategically-placed pockets. Add in the fact that they come in more than 10 washes and three different inseam lengths, and this style earns our Best Overall spot.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're ready to transform your backside, check out the best jeans for a flat butt below:</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-levis-wedgie-straight-fit-womens-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Levi’s Wedgie Straight Fit Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Levi&amp;rsquo;s Wedgie Straight Fit Women's Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/AgkHMcsCcKDi2WR97SFLqXovUyg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Levis-Womens-Wedgie-Straight-Jeans--6a0c61c42a60434980d6f274587c4c7c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Levi's Wedgie fit is one of the best jeans for lifting up the butt, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Wishi</a> stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Adriana Gonzalez-Ramirez</a>. Like the name suggests, the style creates the illusion of a wedgie, but in the best way. "The seaming helps emphasize your curves. They sort of pull up in between your legs—hence the 'Wedgie'—but not uncomfortably. That gives your butt a sort of extra definition," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Katie Donbavand, who tested the Wedgie</a> style along with three other editors. The back pockets are also set high on the bum at a curve, which combined with the high waist, further lifts your butt.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our testers did find that the jeans had less give than other pairs and felt a little tight at the waist, but they did stretch over the course of the day, as most jeans made from 100 percent cotton do.

While all Good American jeans are made to pass the "bum test," this pair of skinnies will really play up your backside. The deep v yoke and side set back pockets create an illusion of roundness, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Joanna Angeles</a>, Head Stylist at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Tobi</a>. The light wash is extra faded on the rear, which Angeles says will further highlight your booty and make your legs look leaner in comparison. Any gaping or bagginess can flatten your behind, and these jeans have a gap-proof waistband and a high waist to hug every curve. Plus, the recycled fabric is extra stretchy and soft, so you won't be constantly lifting up the waist. With all these details that put in the work for you, it's no wonder celebrities from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Megan Fox</a> to Chrissy Teigan wear Good American jeans religiously.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>00-26 | <strong>Rise: </strong>High |<strong> Materials: </strong>98.5% Organic Cotton, 1.5% Elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-bootcut-hudson-jeans-beth-mid-rise-baby-bootcut-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Bootcut</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hudson Jeans Beth Baby Bootcut</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hudson Jeans Beth Mid-Rise Baby Bootcut Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/gZM7umrvScwEXEecFBtT0D29GuA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hudsonwhite-8ec97b8f6c00418cad86945c01b43c8c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Zappos</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the easiest ways to boost your butt is choosing a jean with flap pockets, as the extra fabric adds dimension and calls attention to the area. Sadly jeans with flap pockets seem harder to come by these days. Hudson Jeans to the rescue: the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cult celebrity brand</a> is still designing flap pocket jeans, and you can't go wrong with this classic mid-rise bootcut style. They come in seven different washes, including the perfect white for summer. If you really want to bump up your butt, we suggest selecting the Memory Lane wash as it has some drastic fading on the rear to further highlight your backside. All washes are made with stretch material, so there's no sagging in sight.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>23-34, petite also available | <strong>Rise: </strong>Mid |<strong> Materials: </strong>93% Cotton, 6% Poly, 1% Elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-ankle-everlane-90s-cheeky-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Ankle</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Everlane '90s Cheeky Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/I_K_hOK_qDjwS5zgIzlKrknEezU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign44-b5c0f76b328f4bc6b3e5583ca687c3b1.jpg"> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>They run large.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For jeans that show off both your boots and your booty, go for this ankle length style from Everlane. The raised back hook seam lifts and tightens the behind while the brand's signature "happy pockets" sit high and close together for a perky look. Not only will you look good, but you will feel good knowing that denim is made from organic cotton and microplastic-free dyes and recycled trim. Ankle jeans are great for showing off your footwear, whether that's a sandal or ankle boot, but this style also comes in a regular length if that's more your vibe. And for those with curves, there's a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">curvy fit</a> made for hourglass figures that struggle with gapping at the waist.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>23-35 | <strong>Rise: </strong>High |<strong> Materials: </strong>98% Organic Cotton, 2% Elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-flare-abercrombie--fitch-ultra-high-rise-flare-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Flare</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Abercrombie & Fitch Flared Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch Ultra High Rise Flare Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/W2RcbhXk0-PG2tDSs4hWupPURys=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign45-1ed6ee39649e4ec8af2746846889d2df.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Abercrombie & Fitch</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These jeans from Abercrombie & Fitch check off all the booty boxes.

Not only does it show off your amazing shoes, but you still get the butt enhancing effect of the flare leg without overwhelming your frame. The yoke is slightly curved and the back pockets are far set, rounding out your rear. There are 13 washes to choose from, most of which have that flirty fading on the backside. There's even a faded gray wash that could replace your go-to black jeans.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>23-34 | <strong>Rise: </strong>High |<strong> Materials: </strong>98% Cotton, 2% Elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-embellished-free-people-firecracker-flare-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Embellished</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Free people Flared Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Free people Firecracker Flare Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/SbEPLKIQyJ8kf0sYsKZJwXCeDQA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign47-a1598c73457044b08d3152279d6dbdba.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Free People</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Those with a flat butt may think it's best to avoid calling attention to the area, but the opposite is true. The more embellishments you put on your behind, the better. These firecracker jeans have two suede stars that are strategically placed on your booty to lift and sculpt. The deep v yoke further rounds your rear, while the seam going down the backside literally underlines your curves. The flare leg is timeless and gives you an hourglass shape. We also like the two slit pockets on the front that subtly highlight your hips.

Number one is looking at the yoke of the jeans, which is the horizontal line that runs above the pockets and below the waistband," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Wishi</a> stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Sharon Warten</a>. "The yoke should be v or heart-shaped which helps give that butt-enhancing effect."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">More brands like Good American are designing denim with deep v yokes. Even if a brand doesn't call out the yoke, you can use your own judgment to see if it's angled or runs flat across.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What's the best fit for a flat butt?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While you can wear any style of denim you want, it's best to choose one that hugs your curves if you want to accentuate your butt. "I would stay away from baggy, oversized jeans because this is going to blend your behind in with your legs and give little to no definition to that butt," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Wishi</a> stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Kate Gordon</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Godron's favorite jeans for enhancing the booty? Flares. "It's best to pick something that flares out at the leg, almost giving a bell bottom effect. This is going to make your waist look smaller, hips wider, and give the appearance of a bigger behind," says Gordon.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do I prevent jeans from sagging, especially around the butt?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To avoid the dreaded saggy butt, stick to jeans that are form-fitting around the rear and also have some stretch to them. Materials like elastane and spandex are blended with cotton to create denim that stretches but also recovers back to its original shape and size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It's also important to take good care of your jeans so that they don't stretch out. You don't want to wash them too often — in fact, Levi's recommends you only wash your jeans every 10 wears at most. When you do wash them, be sure to turn them inside out and then let them air dry. If you want to speed up the drying process, you can throw them in the dryer for 10 minutes on the tumble setting. Otherwise, over drying your jeans can destroy the elastane and/or spandex, causing them to stretch out and lose their shape.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ykuM6tn6Kml2Svpr%2FTZqGemZ6oeqe70WadpZmkYq%2B2wNOs</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
