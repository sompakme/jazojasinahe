Calm down. Your metabolism is not what it was.' Nobody wants to hear that."</p><p id=e808Ujf5_cw data-wc=31>Charlize also noted that it's not just the weight gains or losses taking a different toll on her body now, but also the injuries she might incur from strenuous action roles.</p><p id=eiBpRoHfO_ data-wc=16><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Charlize Theron and her two daughters' personal life in rare photos as she turns 48</a></strong></p><p id=eio6JGPh0b data-wc=16><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Inside the insane physical transformations undergone by Hollywood stars: From Cillian Murphy to Charlize Theron</a></p><p id=eNdqAcBQRXXY data-wc=83>She explained: "The thing that really bums me out is that I make action movies now and if I hurt myself, I take way longer to heal than I did in my 20s. More than my face, I wish I had my 25-year-old body that I can just throw against the wall and not even hurt tomorrow. Now, if I don't work out for three days and I go back to the gym, I can't walk.
