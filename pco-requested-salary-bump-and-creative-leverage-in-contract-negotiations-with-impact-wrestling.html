It’s not possible for everyone to be a part of the company and PCO will be one of the stars who will leave the company soon. Now it appears PCO requested a bump in salary and more creative control during the final stages of his contract negotiations.</p><p>PCO joined Impact Wrestling at Hard to Kill 2022 after Ring of Honor announced its hiatus. During his time with the company, he was part of the Honor No More stable and regularly made appearances on television. He had feuds with Eddie Edwards and was involved in a program with Bully Ray and Steve Maclin leading up to Impact Slammiversary as well.</p><p>As previously reported, PCO had given his notice <a href=#>to Impact Wrestling last week</a>. While speaking to&nbsp;<a href=#>Laprade on Les Anti-Pods de la Lutte</a>, PCO revealed that he had essentially agreed to a new deal where he requested more pay and creative control. However, Impact Wrestling didn’t contact him during the final stages of their negotiations.</p><p>“The company began approaching me in White Plains on the weekend of September 8 and 9. They said they wanted to re-sign me, that they wanted me to stay and all that. And that it was important for the company. I asked if they could increase my salary, and creatively speaking, if I could get more involved with my character,” he recalled. “The next day, I thought we were going to agree on terms. It came close twice, then it drew on a bit.</p><p>Then, I was told that we had to reach an agreement, at least on the phone, before Memphis, which was the 22 or 23, in order to know how to book Memphis and Bound for Glory. On Saturday no news, no phone calls, radio silence in a sense. There are a lot of people around me in the locker room who have not been renewed yet and who finished on the 22. So I figured I wasn’t going to stretch it until Bound For Glory, since my contract finishes on October 30. I felt negotiations were tough so I decided to control how I was gonna leave.”</p><p>I think that’s part of the negotiations too. When there’s radio silence after they tell you ‘We want you and we will sign you’. There’s like some kind of a war of nerves that is being played. Who will break first? If they show too much interest, they know you’re going to ask for the moon, but if they show less, they think you’re going to feel less important. The goal is to find the right balance.”</p><p>PCO’s most recent appearance was in the Feast or Fired match at Impact 1000. We will have to wait and see what the future holds for PCO, as the sky is truly the limit for the pro wrestling veteran.</p><p>What’s your opinion on what PCO said? Do you believe Impact Wrestling should have done more to keep him?
