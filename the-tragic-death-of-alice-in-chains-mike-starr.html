The 1990 album Facelift brought them into the light. The release of 1992's Dirt secured their legacy. There was no forgetting Alice In Chains from that point forward. The album generated five hit singles and became a staple of the grunge movement, but the time surrounding&nbsp;Dirt was a chaotic one for the band.</p><p dir=ltr>According to <a href=#>Revolver</a>, Layne Staley's drug problem was in full swing, causing the band to cancel several shows during the album's release tour, and Starr wasn't much better off. Unlike with Staley, Alice In Chains wouldn't look the other way on Starr's substance abuse, and instead gave him the boot in the middle of the tour in 1993.</p><p dir=ltr>Of course, the band didn't say that Mike Starr was fired because of the drugs; that was a conclusion that he'd come to on his own sometime later, according to <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>. Instead, Staley said Starr was let go for "a difference of priorities," with Starr having grown tired of touring and wanting to return home while the band wanted to do what bands do: tour. We might never know who was telling the truth now that both musicians are deceased, but it might be pretty hypocritical for Staley to fire anyone for their drug use.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BmHJwcmhfqbWmedOrmKChk2Kxpq3ToWSonl2WuaqvxGagp2WTna6qutJmpKKjlWLAta3Rq2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
