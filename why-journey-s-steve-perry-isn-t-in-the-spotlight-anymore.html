Each band member got a turn to speak and when Perry stepped to the mic, his words were as much of a surprise as they were a relief to fans who've long waited for the band's beef to be squashed.</p><p>Perry went down the line, thanking each member of the band individually before saying, "All right, guys, I thank you so much for all the music we've written and recorded together. It will be forever in my heart," according to Rolling Stone. Perry singled out Neal Schon's guitar-playing as the standout element of the band's musical prowess that initially attracted him to them, and he even said "I love you" to Arnel Pineda, who he said "sings his heart out every night."</p><p>That's a pretty far cry from his seemingly bitter remarks during the VH-1 Behind The Music, not to mention a clear reconciliation with the two men with whom the public has (possibly unfairly) accused him of snubbing.</p><p>Perry ended his remarks by thanking Journey's fans. "And from my heart, I must tell you, I have been gone a long time, I understand that. But I want you to know, you've never not been in my heart. I want you to know that. And I love each and everyone of you," he said. If you're going to break your silence after a long hiatus, this is how you do it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2FkXFucGeimq6tedGemKynnmKxsLrTZp%2BemaJiwLWx1Z5kqZ2ip8Zurc2ypKiqlWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
